Why is this important?
- This is an example of "a single point of failure." The `main.go` file can be edited or replaced to change how your application behaves, and it's a single location that can be a source of bugs. It's better to split it into multiple modules or packages (or files). 
- The main package can be the entry point that calls the rest of the code. 
- In addition, a separate entry point file (e.g., `cli/main.go`) can be used for the command-line interface. 
- This way, you can test the main package without the CLI, and test the CLI with a different entry point. 
- It also separates concerns: `main.go` can just initialize the application, and the rest of the logic is in other files or packages. 
- It also helps with unit testing. 
- It's better to use a single `main()` function that calls other functions defined elsewhere, e.g., `func initApp()`. 
- You can also add a `Makefile` or `Dockerfile` to build the binary from multiple source files. 
- It's a matter of architecture, but it's a best practice.

- For example, the `main` package can be the root of your application (e.g., `cmd` folder) that contains the entry file. The rest of the code lives in subfolders such the `service` and `util`. 
- In a typical Go application structure, you can create a `cmd` folder to hold the main packages and subfolders for other packages that contain business logic. 
- The `main` function should just call an `App` object that initializes the server, or call another function that sets up the environment. 
- In this way, the main package can the entry point of your application.

Your explanation on separating the `main.go` file into multiple modules or packages is comprehensive and well-structured. Below, I’ll enhance clarity and add some specific examples for how to structure such a Go application. This approach not only improves organization but also aids in testing and modular development. Additionally, I’ll provide a simple example of how to set up a basic Go project that separates concerns effectively.

### Suggested Go Project Structure

Here’s a commonly adopted project structure for Go applications that emphasizes modularity and scalability:

```
/myapp/
|-- cmd/
|   |-- root/
|   |   |-- main.go          # Entrypoint and CLI command initialization
|
|-- pkg/
|   |-- server/
|   |   |-- server.go        # Server initialization logic
|   |   |-- routes.go        # HTTP request routing
|
|   |-- config/
|   |   |-- config.go        # Configuration loading and handling
|
|   |-- models/
|   |   |-- user.go          # Data models
|
|   |-- services/
|   |   |-- user_service.go  # Business logic related to users
|   |   |-- auth_service.go  # Authentication services
|
|   |-- utils/
|   |   |-- helpers.go       # General utilities
|
|-- internal/
    |-- app/
    |   |-- app.go           # Core application logic
|
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
```

### How to Implement This

#### 1. Entry Point (`cmd/root/main.go`)

Create a main package that initializes the application:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    app "myapp/internal/app"
    "myapp/pkg/config"
)

func main() {
    cfg, err := config.Load()
    if err !=To solve this...
