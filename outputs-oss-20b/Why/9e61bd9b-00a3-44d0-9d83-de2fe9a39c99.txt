Why do the numbers of these two different series coincide? In other words, why does a simple random walk on the integers hit 0 in an odd number of steps if and only if the corresponding number of steps in a random walk on the non-negative integers hit -1 in an even number of steps? The first part is straightforward, but how to interpret it in terms of the first series?'

Hence we may show mapping as described earlier: The first series enumerates sequences of ±1 of length 2m+1 with partial sums staying non-negative except final step to -1. Equivalent to simple random walk on ℤ hitting 0 after an odd number of steps: because we start from 0 and after an odd step we are at -1; but to hit 0 we might shift.

But the final explanation: The two series counts same set, but we can interpret them as hitting times of simple random walk: The odd hitting time of 0 corresponds to the even hitting time to -1 in a random walk on the non-negative integers starting at 1.

Hence final ChatGPT response will include:

1. Provide bijection between sequences counted in each sum, e.g., using reflection or complement.

2. Provide combinatorial explanation for equality: both count number of ways to walk from 1 to -1 in 2m steps staying > -1; or from 0 to 0 in 2m+1 steps staying > -1 etc.

3. Provide mapping to first series as hitting times on ℤ.

Let's finalize.

**Detailed final answer**:

- For each m, define N(m) = number of sequences (X_1,…,X_{2m+1}) with X_i∈{±1} for which partial sums S_k = X_1+⋯+X_k satisfy S_k≥0 for k≤2m, and S_{2m+1} = –1. This is exactly the number of ways for a simple random walk starting at 0 to hit –1 for the first time on step 2m+1. Then N(2m+1) = (2m+1)/(m+1) C(2m+1, m). (Combinatorial proof using ballot numbers.)

- Consider sequences of 2m steps of ±1, starting from 1, that stay > -1 (i.e., the walk on the integers never reaches –1 until the last step) and end at –1. The number of such paths is the same number N(2m+1), because we may delete the last step –1 (a step downward). Hence the sum with C(2m, m-1) counts these. Similarly we may consider the walk that stays ≥0 until the last step and ends at -1; the number of such paths is also N(2m+1). By mapping a +1 step to “stay” and a –1 step to “return”, we get the second expression.

- The bijection: take a path counted in the first sum. Reflect the path after its first return to 0; this turns the walk into one that starts at 1, never hits –1 until its last step, and ends at –1 after 2m steps. Conversely, reflect such a path after its final return to 0 to recover the first type.

- Therefore the two sums equal; the first sum counts walks hitting 0 after an odd number of steps. The second sum counts walks hitting –1 after an even number of steps. They are the same set of paths under this bijection, establishing the identity.

Let's craft the final message accordingly. I will craft the final answer with clear statements, proof, and mapping.

Final ChatGPT Response:

Will give step-by-step proof:

1. Introduce definitions: Let $a_m$ denote number of ways simple random walk starts at 0 and hits 0 for the first time at time $2m+1$. Provide formula $a_m = {2m+1\choose m}-(m+1)^{-1}{2m+1\choose m}...$ Actually we show $a_m = \frac{1}{m+1}\binom{2m+1}{m}$? Wait we need to check.

Let's compute: In the first sum the term is $\frac{2m+1}{m+1}\binom{2m+1}{m}$; maybe that's the count for odd hitting times. But we may show this equals the reflection formula for first return times for simple random walk; yes.

Hence final answer: Provide combinatorial mapping and final equality.
