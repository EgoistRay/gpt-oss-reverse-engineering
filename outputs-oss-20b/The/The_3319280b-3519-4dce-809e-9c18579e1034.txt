The function `addEventListenerForScrollToBottom` adds a 'scroll' event listener to the document body. When scrolled, it checks if the bottom is near the bottom of the page, and if so, it calls `loadNewComments` to load the next page of comments.

In the component, on mount, it calls `loadComments(1)`. Then, it calls `addEventListenerForScrollToBottom` to set up the infinite scroll.

Note that the scroll event listener needs to be removed when the component is unmounted.

Thus, in the return function of useEffect, we remove the scroll event listener.

However, there's a problem: the `loadNewComments` function uses `currentPage` in its closure. But `currentPage` is being updated, and unless we have the closure with the latest value, the function may have a stale value.

To avoid that, perhaps it's better to use a Ref to store `currentPage` and access the latest value from there.

Alternatively, we could set up the `loadNewComments` function inside useEffect to capture the correct `currentPage`.

But perhaps the simplest way is to use `useRef` to store the 'currentPage', and read from that when needed.

Similarly, the 'loading' state can be stored in `loadingRef`, as a boolean Ref, to avoid triggering re-renders when setting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's acceptable to have 'loading' as state variable; we can also set up a 'loadMore' flag.

Alternatively, we can write the code to handle the possible race conditions.

In this code, in the initial effect (useEffect), we can use an empty dependency array, so it runs on mount.

In the `addEventListenerForScrollToBottom` function, the 'loadNewComments' function will capture the current 'currentPage' from 'currentPage' variable, which may be stale.

But, since 'currentPage' is in state and being updated via setCurrentPage after each load, it may not reflect the latest.

Therefore, to avoid closure over stale states, we can use 'useEffect' to set 'currentPage' and 'loading' in a way that the 'loadNewComments' can access the current page.

Alternatively, to avoid this issue, we can write the load function to accept the page number as a parameter.

Similarly, we can define 'loadNewComments' function inside the scroll event listener, so that it captures the latest 'currentPage' via closure.

Alternatively, the best practice is to use a function that uses 'currentPage' via useRef.

Given that, we can modify the 'currentPage' to be a Ref.

Thus, in code:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
const commentsPerPage = 20;

const CommentViewer = () => {
  const { articleId } = useParams();
  const [comments, setComments] = useState([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [hasMore, setHasMore] = useState(true);
  const pageRef = useRef(1); // Ref to store current page
  const isFetchingRef = useRef(false); // Ref to avoid multiple fetches

  const loadComments = async (page) => {
    if (isFetchingRef.current) return;
    isFetchingRef.current = true;
    setLoading(true);
    try {
      const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/articles/${articleId}/comments?page=${page}`);
      if (res.ok) {
        const data = await res.json();
        // Assuming data is an array of comments
        if (data.length < commentsPerPage) {
          setHasMore(false);
        }
        if (page === 1) {
          setComments(data);
        } else {
          setComments(prevComments => [...prevComments, ...data]);
        }
        pageRef.current = page + 1;
      } else {
        console.error(`Failed to fetch comments for page ${page}`);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error fetching comments for page ${page}:`, error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
      isFetchingRef.current = false;
    }
  }

  const loadNextPage = () => {
    if (!loading && hasMore) {
      loadComments(pageRef.current);
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    loadComments(1);
  }, [articleId]);

  const handleScroll = () => {
    if (window.innerHeight + document.documentElement.scrollTop >= document.documentElement.offsetHeight - 200) {
      loadNextPage();
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    
    return () => window
