**Step 3: Research**

**1. What does "Yangi ko'rik" mean in Uzbek, and does it have any cultural or historical significance?**

"Yangi" translates to "new," and "ko'rik" typically means "to look" or "to see." However, in Uzbek, "ko'rik" can also be a term for a small settlement or a community, particularly in historical contexts. Hence, "Yangi ko'rik" can be interpreted as "new settlement" or "new community." This suggests a possible reestablishment or development phase in its history, reflecting a period of growth or resettlement.

**2. Why was the settlement previously known as Zaqi? Does this suggest a change in the demographic or linguistic composition over time?**

The name "Zaqi" could have roots in various ethnic or historical contexts. Without further specific historical data, it's likely that the name change reflects administrative reforms or shifts in demographic composition, perhaps aligning with a national movement towards standardizing place names or reflecting changes in local governance.

**3. What criteria define a village in Uzbekistan, and how does Yangi ko'rik meet these criteria?**

In Uzbekistan, a village is generally a small, rural settlement with limited administrative autonomy compared to cities or towns. Criteria include a population size below a threshold (often less than 15,000 inhabitants), primarily agrarian economic activities, and basic infrastructural facilities. Yangi ko'rik, with a population of 2,300 and its classification as a village, aligns with these criteria.

**4. Does the classification as a village affect its administrative governance or resource allocation?**

Yes,
