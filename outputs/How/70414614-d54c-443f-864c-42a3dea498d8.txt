How many edges are there in this graph?" They might want answer in terms of m and n. So we answer that there's 4m + 5(-2m + 3n - 2) = 5(3n - 2) - 4m edges.

Alternatively, combine if one desires: 35n - 18? Wait, 12m + 15n = 3(4m+5n). So answer: 3(4m+5n). Given that. So answer. Alternatively 12m + 15n.

We might also mention that there is greater weight not used for soap foam graph. But that's not asked.

Thus answer: 12m + 15n.

But maybe they want explanation: The graph is a planar graph with vertices and edges. So graph edges can be counted using Euler's formula? But they ask how many edges? Actually we can derive edges anyway.

Thus answer: 12m + 15n.

Thus number of edges in graph: 12m+15n.

Thus if the graph has m faces and n holes, edges = 12m+15n? Wait, after factoring out 3? Let's check if we can have 3(4m+5n). That is edges.

Simplify: 12m + 15n = 3(4m+5n). So answer.

Hence answer: 3(4m+5n). That is the edges count.

Alternatively if we want to double-check: If m faces and n holes, edges = 4m + 5p. But p= -2m+3n-2. So edges = 4m + 5(-2m+3n-2) = 4m -10m +15n -10 = -6m + 15n - 10. Wait, we mis-simplified: Let's carefully compute: 5p = 5(-2m + 3n - 2) = -10m + 15n -10. Then 4m +5p = 4m -10m +15n -10 = -6m + 15n -10. But we earlier simplified wrong. Let's re-evaluate: earlier we had 4m + 5(-2m+3n-2) = 4m-10m+15n-10 = -6m +15n -10. And we claimed earlier that equals 12m + 15n? That is wrong. Wait, earlier we had 12m + 15n. But that seems inconsistent. Let's recalc from scratch:

Start from equations:

Equation [1]: 3F = v + e [1]
Equation [2]: F = e - v +1 [2] (Euler)

Solve [1], [2]. Substituting [2] into [1]: 3(e-v+1)=v+e => 3e-3v+3 = v+e => bring: 3e-3v+3 - v - e = 0 => 2e -4v+3 = 0 => 2e = 4v -3 => dividing by 2: e = 2v -3/2. That seems wrong. Wait, we need integer number of edges, so something is off. Let's carefully recompute. But we might have made mistake: [1] is 3F = v + e? But is that correct? Or maybe it's 3F = 2v + e? Wait, earlier we derived 2v + e = 3F. That is correct: for each face, three edges on its boundary; each edge assigned to two faces; thus sum(face boundary edges) = 3F = 2e. That gave 2v + e = 3F. So 3F = 2v+e. So 3F = 2n1 + e? Wait, v = n1, fine. So 3F = 2v + e. Then 3F = 2v + e. Then substitute F = e - v +1: 3(e - v +1) = 2v + e => 3e -3v +3 = 2v + e => bring LHS: 3e-3v+3 -2v - e =0 => (3e - e) + (-3v -2v) + 3 = 0 => 2e -5v + 3 = 0 => 2e = 5v -3 => e = (5v -3)/2. We had earlier same: 2e = 5v - 3. Yes.

Now v = n1 = 2p + m. So e
