An example: The function $f(x) = -x^2 \cdot \mathbb{1}_{[-2,2]}(x)$ is in $L^\infty(-2,2)$.

But this is not the function in question.

Alternatively, let's try to find a bounded function that is discontinuous on a set of measure zero but unbounded on a set of measure zero, but this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the function in question is bounded, but the essential boundedness is violated because of the pointwise unboundedness.

But perhaps the issue is that the function is bounded but the essential supremum is infinite due to the pointwise unboundedness.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

In general, for a measurable function $f$ defined on a Lebesgue measurable subset $X$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we can define the essential supremum of $f$ as

$\text{ess sup}_{x \in X} f(x) = \inf \{ M \in \mathbb{R} : \mu(\{ x \in X : f(x) > M \}) = 0 \} $.

Similarly, the essential infimum is defined analogously.

Now, the function is in $L^\infty$ if and only if its essential supremum is finite.

Now, suppose the function is essentially bounded, i.e., its essential supremum is finite, but it takes infinite values on a set of measure zero. Then the $L^\infty$ norm is finite.

Now, in our function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}$ on $(-2,2]$, the function is finite everywhere except at $x=2$, where it's unbounded.

So, the function is unbounded at a single point, i.e., $x=2$, which is a set of measure zero.

Therefore, the function is essentially bounded, as the measure of the set where it is unbounded is zero. Indeed, $f(x)$ is bounded outside an arbitrarily small interval near $x=2$.

But perhaps the problem lies in that the function is unbounded at a point that is the limit point of the domain.

Specifically, perhaps we cannot assign a finite value of the function in a neighborhood of $x=2$, as it tends towards infinity.

Now, for the function $f(x)$ to be in $L^\infty$, the function must be essentially bounded; that is, there must be a finite number $M$ such that the function is bounded by $M$ outside a set of measure zero.

But in our function, for any $M > 0$, the set $\{ x \in (-2,2] : f(x) > M \}$ is the interval $(2 - \frac{1}{M}, 2]$, which has positive measure $1/M$.

Hence, the set where $f$ exceeds any fixed $M$ has positive measure for any $M$.

Thus, the essential supremum is infinite.

Wait, this suggests that the function is not essentially bounded.

Indeed, the set $A_M = \{ x \in (-2,2] : \frac{1}{x - 2} > M \} = \{ x \in (-2,2] : x - 2 < \frac{1}{M} \}$.

But as $x - 2$ is negative, $x - 2 < 0$, so $x - 2 < \frac{1}{M}$ is always true.

But perhaps we need to be more precise.

We see that as $x$ approaches $2$ from below, $x - 2$ approaches zero from below, so $\frac{1}{x - 2}$ tends to $-\infty$.

Wait, perhaps we made a mistake earlier.

Let me be more precise.

Let me define $f: (-2,2] \to \mathbb{R}$ by $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2}$ for $x \in (-2,2)$, and $f(2) = 0$.

Now, for $x \in (-2,2)$, $x - 2$ is negative, i.e., $x - 2 \in (-4,0)$, so $x - 2 < 0$.

Then, $\frac{1}{x - 2} < 0$, as the denominator is negative.

Thus, $f$ is negative on $(-2,2)$.

Moreover, as $x$ approaches $2$ from below, $x - 2 \to 0^-$, so $\frac{1}{x - 2} \to -\infty$.

Similarly, as
