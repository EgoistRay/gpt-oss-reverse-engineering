How did the role of the jury evolve in Athenian democracy, and what political views did Pericles express in his funeral oration? Additionally, how did Pericles ensure the functioning of democracy and what measures did he take to promote regular civic participation? How did Thucydides praise the constitution of Athens, and what were the key characteristics of Athenian democracy according to him? Finally, why can Athens be considered a city of democratic ideology, and who made decisions in the democratic system?

In Athenian democracy, the role of the jury evolved significantly over time. Initially, juries were small panels of citizens who were expected to have some expertise in legal matters. However, under reforms, particularly by Ephialtes in the mid-5th century BCE, juries became much larger, consisting of hundreds or even thousands of citizens. This expansion made it extremely difficult for anyone to influence the court's decision through bribery or persuasion, thereby strengthening the democratic process and ensuring that justice was determined by a broad cross-section of the citizenry.

Pericles, in his famous funeral oration, articulated several key political views that defined the ideology of Athenian democracy. He emphasized that power belonged to the people as a whole, not to a select few, and that all citizens, regardless of their social status, had the opportunity to participate in governance. He highlighted that advancement was based on merit and virtue rather than birth or wealth, and he stressed the importance of equality before the law. Pericles also praised the balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility, noting that citizens were both free in their personal lives and obedient to the laws in public matters.

To ensure that democracy functioned properly, Pericles implemented several measures. He provided financial compensation to citizens who performed public services, such as serving on juries or holding public office. This compensation was crucial because it allowed poorer citizens to participate in civic duties without suffering economic hardship. Additionally, he introduced payments for attendance at the ecclesia (assembly), which encouraged regular participation in the democratic process. By removing financial barriers, Pericles ensured that all citizens, regardless of their economic status, could contribute to the governance of the city.

Thucydides, in his account of the Athenian constitution, praised the system for its emphasis on equality and the rule of law. He described Athens as a democracy where the law applied equally to all citizens, regardless of wealth or status. Thucydides noted that advancement in public office was based on merit and virtue, not on birth or class. He also highlighted the active role of citizens in governance, emphasizing that all citizens had the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. According to Thucydides, the Athenian constitution was characterized by the balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility, where citizens were both free in their personal lives and obedient to the laws in public matters.

The key characteristics of Athenian democracy, as described by Thucydides, include the sovereignty of the people, the rule of law, equality before the law, the ability to advance based on worth and virtue, freedom of speech, and the encouragement of civic engagement. These features distinguished Athenian democracy from other forms of government, such as oligarchies or monarchies, where power was concentrated in the hands of a few.

Athens can be considered a city of democratic ideology because its government was fundamentally based on the principle of popular sovereignty. Citizens played an active role in governance through institutions like the ecclesia, where they could debate and vote on important matters. The legal system was designed to apply equally to all citizens, and there were mechanisms in place to ensure fair administration and encourage broad participation in civic duties. This combination of institutions and values created a society where democracy was not just a political system but a way of life.

In the democratic system of Athens, decisions were made by the ecclesia, which was composed of all eligible male citizens. This assembly met regularly to debate and vote on matters of state, including legislation, foreign relations, and military affairs. The ecclesia was the ultimate source of political authority in Athens, and its decisions were binding on the entire community. Citizens would gather in the Pnyx, a hill near the Acropolis, to participate in these meetings, ensuring that the voices of all citizens had a direct impact on the governance of the city.
