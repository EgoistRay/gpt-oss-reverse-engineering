A=0.03\,$. In other words the coefficient is about 0.03.  (If you take log base e you get about 0.0242.) 
The students answer was:  “In fact you end up with essentially a zero‐slope – i.e. D≈const.  In the log10‐fit you get 
$$log10R≈−0.017A+1.04\,, $$ 
so in linear form R≈1.14 exp(−0.004A) or ≈1.14−0.03 A.  (Using ln one finds d≈−0.0242 – ≈−0.03 if you round). ”

This looks like a puzzle. Probably it's gibberish or a stylized representation. Could it be something like "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"? Or "This is a test"? But seems odd.

It looks like a random mixture of punctuation and dots, em-dashes, maybe stylized text. There are underscores, maybe Morse code? Because dot-dash patterns like ".-.-" etc. The text contains a lot of periods, commas, etc.

Let's examine: The question likely is to decode or interpret the hidden text. For example, the phrase "This... (maybe..?) – It **... ...... ... ...** ... ..???" There are many ellipses. Could this be some hint for something like "The real thing is hidden"? Could be "This is just a placeholder" puzzle like "Lorem Ipsum".

The line "... This,…...? = ? This..…...." might be referencing a phrase or a logic puzzle. The next line: "The re‑... ...?…..? The ....... **...**?....." Might be "The real ..." Actually "re-" suggests something, maybe "real"? "The real ?" Hard.

Maybe it's a puzzle: We have a series of lines with punctuation, maybe each line is a clue to a word. Could each line correspond to a phrase from a known song? Eg "This … maybe?" referencing "This is the beginning of madness" etc.

But maybe it's an anagram: The characters could hide letters. For each dot maybe a letter. But no.

Could it be a stylized text that hides a phrase in the count of dots? For instance first line has something like "... (maybe..?)" The number of dots might encode letters as Morse code. For example, ... = S (three dots). Maybe each group of dots separated by spaces or punctuation: for example, "It **... ...... ... ...**" includes four groups: ... (...=S), ......(=H?), ... etc? Let's parse: There is "**... ...... ... ...**". That is three dots, space, four dots, space, three dots, space, three dots? Actually "..." (S), " ......"? Wait exactly: "**... ...... ... ...**". We break: "...", " ......", " ...", " ..."? But there is no separation: It's exactly "... ...... ... ...". Let's identify groups separated by spaces: "..." is group1, " ......" but there's a space then " ......" but maybe it's " ......" including a space? Actually string shows: "**... ...... ... ...**". So that string: "...", " ......", " ...", " ..."? Hard.

Better to consider each line separate: maybe it's a phrase but dots replace letters? Eg "This... (maybe..?)" Could mean "This is maybe something"? For example, "This ... maybe
