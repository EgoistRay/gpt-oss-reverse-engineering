An array of shape (K x N x D), where for each particle, the gradient of the kernel with respect to each dimension at each evaluation point.

The function should efficiently handle large K (number of evaluation points) and N (number of particles), and use only publicly available packages.

Note that the key idea is that computing the gradient of the kernel involves computing the difference between positions x_i and evaluation points y_k, and applying the functional form of the kernel's gradient.

Ok.

Approach:

- First, make sure to define the mathematical expressions for the kernels.

- The smoothing lengths h_i need to be determined per particle according to the 2D version of the provided condition:

     h_i = alpha_2D * (m_i / rho_i)^(1/2)

Given that in our case, mass m_i is presumably uniform or not specified; perhaps we can set m_i = 1, or perhaps we can set h_i proportional to (1 / rho_i)^{1/2}, with alpha_2D being a scaling factor, perhaps for computational purposes.

But perhaps in this problem, we simply need to compute h_i as a function of density at the particle's position.

In practice, the kernel is computed over pairwise distances. Since the question provides us with arrays of positions of particles and evaluation points, we can compute pairwise differences between particles and evaluation points.

We need to compute:

- For each evaluation point y_k, its contributions from each particle x_i.

- For each particle x_i, we know its density at that point, i.e., rho(x_i). So we can compute h_i = alpha_2D * sqrt(1 / rho_i)

[But the problem says alpha_2D * (m_i / rho_i)^{1/2}, yet m_i is not specified. Since we don't have explicit particle masses, perhaps we can set m_i = 1.

Alternatively, perhaps m_i is a constant per unit mass.

In practice, maybe we can set m_i = 1.

Thus, alpha_2D is a scaling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set alpha_2D = 1.

In any case, our function will need to accept the positions of particles and evaluation points, and compute the densities at the positions of the particles, and finally compute h_i.

We'll need to handle this process efficiently.

We aim to use broadcasting and vectorized operations via NumPy to compute the pairwise differences of positions, which is standard.

We need to compute all pairwise distances between particles and evaluation points, that is, for all evaluation points y_k, find contributions from all particles i.

Similarly, we need to compute kernel values and their gradients.

Ok.

Key steps:

- For each particle i at position x_i, with density rho_i, compute h_i = alpha_2D * sqrt(m_i / rho_i). Since m_i is perhaps 1 or a mass per particle. For the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can set m_i = 1.

- For each evaluation point y_k, compute the contribution from particle i, which requires evaluating the kernel function W(r_{ik}, h_i) * m_i, and adding it to the density at y_k.

- For the gradient, compute the derivative of W with respect to the position y_k, or gradient in the physical space at y_k, which sums over particles' contributions.

Given the standard Gaussian and von Neumann kernels, and their gradients.

We'll need to define the functional forms of W and grad_W.

The standard Gaussian kernel in 2D is commonly defined as:

W(r, h) = (1 / (pi h^2)) * exp(- (r / h)^2)

Similarly, its gradient (with respect to y):

grad_W(r, h) = - (2 / (pi h^4)) * r * exp(- (r / h)^2) * (r̂)     [r̂ is the unit vector from y to x]

But we can avoid unit vector expressions by computing vector differences.

Similarly, for the von Neumann kernel, in 2D, it's commonly defined as:

W(r, h) = (1 / (2pi h^2)) * (1 - 0.5 * (r / h)^2) if 0 <= r <= sqrt(2) h

But to be accurate, we need to define this kernel more precisely.

Therefore, we'll need to implement both the kernel and its gradient for each position.

Implementation Plan:

1. Accept as input the particle positions X: (N x D), evaluation points Y: (K x D), and rho: (N,). For simplicity, D=2.

2. For each particle, compute h_i = alpha_2D * sqrt(m_i / rho_i). As m_i may be set to 1, unless otherwise specified
