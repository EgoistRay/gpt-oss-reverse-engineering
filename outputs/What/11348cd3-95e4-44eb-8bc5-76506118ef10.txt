What is the main result of this paper regarding the relationship between the $\alpha$-criticality of $\mathcal{F}^*$ and the existence of a solution to the optimization problem $\min_{y \in \mathcal{F}^*_\epsilon} \{ \langle y, x \rangle \}$ for sufficiently small $\epsilon$ and for all $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$? Specifically, explain how this result connects the notion of $\alpha$-criticality with the behavior of the minimization problem as $\epsilon$ approaches zero.

Answer to Problem 1:

The main result of the paper is that an element $\mathcal{F} \in \mathcal{K}^n$ is $\alpha$-critical if and only if the optimization problem $\min_{y \in \mathcal{F}^*_\epsilon} \{ \langle y, x \rangle \}$ has no solution for sufficiently small $\epsilon > 0$ and for all $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$. This means that if $\mathcal{F}$ is not $\alpha$-critical, then for any $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$, there exists a solution to the minimization problem for $\epsilon$ small enough. Conversely, if $\mathcal{F}$ is $\alpha$-critical, then there will be some $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$ such that as $\epsilon$ approaches zero, the minimization problem has no solution. This result connects $\alpha$-criticality to the asymptotic behavior of the minimization problem as $\epsilon \to 0$.

Problem 2: The paper discusses a characterization of the $\omega$-criticality in terms of a certain minimization problem. Explain how this characterization works and what it implies. Specifically, discuss how the lack of solution as $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ for all $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$ relates to the $\omega$-criticality of $\mathcal{F}$.

Answer to Problem 2:

The characterization for $\omega$-criticality is that $\mathcal{F}$ is $\omega$-critical on $\mathcal{K}$ if and only if the optimization problem $\min_{y \in \mathcal{F}^*_\epsilon} \langle y, x \rangle$ has no solution on $\mathcal{K}_+^n$ as $\epsilon \downarrow 0$ (for $\epsilon$ small enough). Essentially, for $\omega$-criticality, the lack of solutions to the minimization problem as $\epsilon$ approaches zero for all $x \in \mathcal{K}_+^n$ indicates that $\mathcal{F}$ has an $\omega$-critical point on $\mathcal{K}$. This characterization connects the lack of solutions in the minimization problem to the $\omega$-criticality of $\mathcal{F}$ and provides a way to test for $\omega$-criticality via the minimization problem.

Problem 3: In the paper, there's a discussion on the "criticality index." Define this index and explain its significance in the context of this paper. Why is it useful to have an index that measures how close a given element is to being critical?

Answer to Problem 3: 

In the context of the paper, the "criticality index" is an indicator that measures how close an element is to being critical. The index can be used to quantify the "criticality" of an element by measuring how far it is from being a critical point on the given set in the context of the optimization problem. The index, which typically means the number or range of critical points that might be at or near or near by.
