How to fix" maybe: use `this.$router`, or `this.$router.go(-1)`. Wait the question: "Vue router push from a button that isn't a link".

They ask: I'm building a small webapp where the user will have to login and then navigate through the app. My navigation is handled by an `<ul/>` with a list of `<div>`s. I'm trying to create a button that redirects to the previous page. The code below works with a link but I want it not to be a link. How can I do it?

So they'd show the code with router-link and with router.push. The problem: they want to "not be a link" maybe they don't want <router-link> but just <div> with click event. But using router.push in method fails because of this. They ask: "How to fix it?".

Answer: In Vue, `this.$router` is available. Use `<div @click="goBack">`. Then in method: `goBack() { this.$router.back(); }` or use `router.go(-1)`.

Also you need to bind the click event: `<div class="sidebar__nav" @click="goBack">`. Then the method will be defined correctly.

Also we should ensure the event binding is inside root component. In script, use:

export default {
  methods: {
     goBack() {
       this.$router.back()
     }
  }
}

Also we can use `this.$router.go(-1)`.

Thus final answer: Use `this.$router.push` inside a method with proper binding of `@click`. Provide example. So final message: "Use the router instance in Vue methods".

Let's craft final ChatGPT answer: show the code snippet.

Also mention: `this.$router.push` will not work if you call it incorrectly; you need to refer to router instance. In Vue CLI, you can use `this.$router`. Provide final.

Let's produce final answer.

Final ChatGPT output:

Explain: In Vue, the router instance is attached to each component via `$router`. Instead of using `<router-link>`, add event handler: `<div ... @click="goBack">` and in methods: `goBack(){ this.$router.push('/')}` or `this.$router.go(-1)`.

Add note: In template use `@click="goBack"` not `<router-link :to="{name:'Dashboard'}">`.

Also ensure script's export default includes method.

Let's craft final message.

Ok. Let's produce final output.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>`router-link` creates a link element.  
If you just want to use a normal element and navigate when it is
clicked, call the router from a method.  
In a component the router is available as `this.$router`.

```html
<!-- sidebar navigation -->
<ul class="sidebar__nav__options">
  <li>
    <div class="sidebar__nav" @click="goBack">Back</div>
  </li>
  <li v-for="option in navOptions" :key="option.route.name">
    <router-link :class="{'sidebar__nav__active': isActive(option.route.name)}"
                 :to="option.route">
      <div class="sidebar__nav"><i :class="option.icon"></i> {{ option.value }}</div>
    </router-link>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    goBack () {
      // navigate back to the previous page
      this.$router.go(-1)          // or this.$router.push('/dashboard')
    }
  }
}
```

`@click="goBack"` binds the click to the method, and in that method we
use Vueâ€™s router instance (`this.$router`) to perform navigation without
using a link.
