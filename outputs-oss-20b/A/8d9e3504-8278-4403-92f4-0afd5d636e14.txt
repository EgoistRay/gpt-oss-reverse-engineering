A\) and \(B\) are independent, so we can
use the standard binomial distribution.  
The probability that at most one \(Y_i\) equals \(1\) (i.e. at most one
\(X_i\) is odd) is

\[
\boxed{P\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^nY_i\le 1\Bigr)=
\Pr(Y_1=1)\Pr(Y_2=0)\cdots\Pr(Y_n=0)+\sum_{i=1}^{n}
\Pr(Y_i=0)\prod_{j\ne i}\Pr(Y_j=1)} .
\]

--------------------------------------------------------------------

**If the \(A\)â€“events are not independent** (for example they are
independent but not identically distributed), we still have independence
between \(X_i\) and \(X_j\); hence the same reasoning applies and the
formula above holds.  
In general, if the \(A_i\) are not independent, the above probability
cannot be expressed without extra information about their joint
distribution.
The problem is much easier than it appears.  Note that $B$ being true implies $A\_1$ is false, which in turn implies $X\_1$ is odd.  So all but the first terms must be zero.  Thus the probability is $1-P(X\_1=1 \mid A\_1)$.
Now, we want the probability that $X\_1=1$ given $A\_1$ is true.  Since $X\_1$ is odd if $A\_1$ is true, we want the probability that $X\_1=1$ given $X\_1$ is odd.  This probability is 1/2.
Thus the answer is $1-1/2=0.5$.
Note that this holds if $n=1$.  This answer is *independent* of $n$ as long as $n \ge 1$.  If $n=0$, there is no answer.
It seems that the key is that the probability of $B$ is 0, so it is the zero event.
If we consider a similar problem, where $X\_n$ is even or odd with probabilities 0.4 and 0.6, then the answer is still 0.5.  This problem seems more general.

The key point that the problem is easy to solve was that the probability that $X\_i$ is odd when $A\_i$ is true is 1.  In that sense the probability that $A$ is true is independent.
We need to analyze the user query: They gave a problem: $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ random integers. Probability that $X_i$ is even is 1/2 independent of each other and independent of $B$. $B$ is a Boolean variable, probability of $B$ being true is 0. If $B$ is true, all $X_i$ are odd. If $B$ is false, $X_i$ have no restrictions. We want probability that $X_i$ are even and at most one is odd. They want probability that $X_1$ is odd, at most 1 $X_i$ is odd? Wait: They want "X_i are even and at most one X_i is odd"? This is inconsistent: If all are even, then none odd, which satisfies at most 1 odd. But "and at most one X_i is odd" means we want probability that at most one $X_i$ is odd, and all other $X_i$ are even? Actually they say "X_i are even and at most one X_i is odd" maybe meaning "X_i are even except possibly one" or "all X_i are even except at most one odd." But if B is False (the only case where X_i can be even or odd), each X_i has independent 1/2 probability of being even and 1/2 odd. We want prob that at most 1 odd among them. So that is P(0 odds) + P(1 odd). If each X_i independent, with p=1/2 odd, then probability of exactly j odds among n is C(n,j)*(1/2)^n. So probability at most 1 odd = C(n,0)+C(n,1)*(1/2)^n = (1 + n)*(1/2)^n? Wait compute:

P(0 odds) = (1/2)^n
P(1 odd) = n*(1/2)^n
Total = (n+1)*(1/2)^n

But we
