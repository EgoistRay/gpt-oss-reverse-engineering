It seems like you're looking to automate a function or calculation for each column in an Excel table using VBA that involves handling the `CSL_Columns_AutoComplete`, `CSL_Columns_Dropdown`, and some specific calculations on each row. Below is a conceptual outline and a starting code that helps you begin automating these tasks:

### Step 1: Automate CPLF Provider Wizard
This is a wider topic that may involve massive time series being processed. However, for demonstration:

```vba
Sub SaveResult(condition)
   ' ... code to handle result storing and default
End Sub

' Assume version control and global setting of CPL and dynamic table rows.
```

Your text seems to be a blend of requests and a broad discussion about working with Excel VBA for automating tasks, placeholding logic, and a series of symbolic functions that are uniquely contextual or metaphoric. In the context you're providing—such as redefining the idea of such functions with perhaps imperativeness or conditional logic encoded in pseudo-VBA—I can help you structure an approach or get a clearer code snippet.

In response to let's-stage your current thoughts in an actionable sense:

**Idea**: *Automating within Excel using VBA to perform logic-based calculations.*

**Focusing**: You have `cs` as a string within a function to illustrate "conditional" programming, presumably you want to execute actions or checks based on conditions relevant to `cs`.

**Illustration**: Let me attempt to build an answer or concept only related to the sensible part of your request:

### VBA Example with a Function `Interpretor`

```vba
Function Interpret(cs As String) As String

   ' Here we interpret "cs" string and provide a condition
   Dim condition As Boolean
   Dim interpretationResult As String

   If cs = "" Then
      interpretationResult = "Default Interpretation"
   Else
      ' Let's kind of consider that the condition is repeated pattern recognition
      If InStr(cs, "pattern") > 0 Then
         condition = True
      End If

      Tension "Interpreting with condition:"
      If condition Then
          interpretationResult = "Condition met! " & "Interpretation based on condition."
      Else
          interpretationResult = "Condition not met. Default."
      End If

   End If

   ' Return interpretation result
   Interpret = interpretationResult

End Function
```

- **Example usage**: In any cell or module call: `=Interpret("some string that might match pattern")`

**Note**: This is just a skeleton to give you a feeling of how to organize logic. It's overly
