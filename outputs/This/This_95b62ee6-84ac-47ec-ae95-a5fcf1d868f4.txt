This is the final code.

But let's cross-check with other test: Suppose n=2,m=1? But we have n>=m.

Edge: n==2 m==1: Should be '1/1' maybe? Wait but for m == 1, the only way to win is to win first round. So there is no possibility of losing. So probability 1. Let's test.

Input 2 1: n=2 m=1. n - m = 1, k = 2-1=1 -> binom(1,1)=1, denominator binom(2,1)=2 -> probability 1/2? Wait but we earlier considered m=1: first round must be win, probability 1/(n+1). For n=2, probability 1/3? Wait earlier analysis gave probability 1/(n+1). So for n=2, probability 1/3. But our formula gave 1/2. Something wrong.

Let's analyze again: For m=1, the only win we need: we win the first round, else we lose. The probability that first round is a win is 1/(n+1). Because there are n+1 positions of the single win among (m+n). For n=2,m=1, probability 1/(2+1)=1/3. But our formula gave 1/2. That indicates the formula may hold only for m >= 2? Let's test with n=3,m=1: formula n-m=2,k=3-1=2 -> binom(2,2)=1 denominator binom(3,1)=3 -> 1/3. Wait but earlier we predicted 1/(n+1)=1/4. So difference again.

Let's test again using enumeration with n=2,m=1: All permutations of 1 W and 2 L (3 total). Permutations: WLL, LWL, LLW. The event we win the first round: Only WLL qualifies. That's probability 1/3. Let's compute denominator n choose m? That would be binom(3,1)=3. Number of winning permutations: count sequences of length 3 with 1 W and 2 L where the first element is W? That's exactly 1. So numerator 1. So probability 1/3. Good.

But earlier we computed binom(n-m,k) with n-m=1,k=1 gave 1, denominator 2 -> 1/2. Wait denominator is binom(3,1)=3? Wait we incorrectly computed denominator earlier. For n=2,m=1, binom(n+m, m) = binom(3,1) = 3. Good. So probability = binom(1,1)/binom(3,1) = 1/3. That's correct.

But we mis earlier due to mis compute: 2 choose 1 is 2. Wait that's wrong; denominator should be binom(n+m, m) = binom(3,1) = 3.

Thus formula works for m=1.

Let's double-check with n=3,m=1: binom(n-m,k)=binom(2,2)=1, denominator = binom(4,1)=4 -> 1/4; matches earlier 1/(n+1)? Actually n+1=4, yes matches.

So formula works for all m <= n.

Edge: n=0,m=0. Probability of winning? There are no rounds; I guess you win trivially? Let's compute formula: n-m = 0, k = m-1 = -1. binom(-1, -1) = 1, denominator binom(0,0)=1 -> 1/1. So probability 1. So we can just return 1/1. Good.

Edge: n=0, m>=1: n - m negative, so probability 0, we return 0/1. Good.

Thus all good.

Implementation details: reading input, compute as above.

We must output 'a/b', where a/b simplified.

Edge: For probability 0/1 or 1/1, we output '0/1' or '1/1'.

Now we need to ensure we output the result for each test case on a new line.

Now we need to produce final answer: Provide code in C++17.

But we also need to produce final explanation and reasoning. Provide final message: "The probability that the first m rounds have at least one win each is equal to the probability that the unique win among each consecutive block of m rounds lies in the last m positions of that block. By symmetry, for n+m rounds there are binom(n+m, m) equally likely orders of the m
