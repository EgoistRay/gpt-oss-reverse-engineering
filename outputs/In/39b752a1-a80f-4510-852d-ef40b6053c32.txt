In the context of the question, the article itself might be a source for some of the answers, especially regarding the 2016 season.

Let's check the external link for the "2022 Men's League Standings" and "2022 Women's League Standings". The links provided are likely to point to the official league website for standings. The 2022 men's and women's standings could indicate the current champions.

Let's think of the answer:

Men's league champions in 2022: The 2022 Men’s League champion is the "St. George's" or "St. George's" maybe? I recall that St. George's won the 2017 season. Let's check memory: The 2017 men's league champion was "St. George's" with 9 points. For 2022, I think "St. George's" again. Or maybe the current champion is "The University College of the Virgin Islands" (maybe "St. John" etc). Let's not guess.

Better to use the 2022 men's standings link.

The link: "https://www.svenskalag.se/menliga/2022/Standing" likely contains the table.

But I don't have direct access here. I need to approximate from known data.

Let's recall that the men's league is often dominated by "St. George's" and "St. George's (St. George's College)". Actually, "St. George's College" is a team? Wait: There is a "St. George's" team that competes in the league.

But we need the champion. The champion would be the team that finishes first after the final round of matches.

In 2022, the men's champion may be "St. George's". Let’s check the 2022 season summary. According to Wikipedia (the page for "2018-2019" etc). But I cannot guarantee.

Alternatively, the champion might be "St. John's".

Let's search memory: The men's champion for 2022 might be "S. George's" or "St. George's (St. George's)."

Let's search: "2022 St. George's VFL champion".

Better approach: I can approximate from known patterns: The men's champion often is either "St. George's" or "St. John's."

But I need to be accurate.

Let's search my memory for "VFL 2022 men's champion" - I recall "St. George's (St. George's)".

Let's confirm by referencing the "2022 Men's League Standings" link. That link is likely to list standings. I can approximate the top.

But I don't have the actual page. But I can approximate: The 2022 men's champion might be "St. George's".

Let's look at "St. George's team in VFL" - it's "St. George's" from St. George's College? Actually, "St George" maybe a team "St. George" from "St George's College" in St. Thomas? I'm not certain.

Alternatively, the men's champion could be "St. John's" or "St. John".

But the VFL champion historically for men: 2018: "St. George's" - yes. 2019: "St. George's" again. 2020: Season disrupted by COVID. 2021: "St. George's" again? I'm not 100% sure.

Let's search: "St. George's VFL 2021 champion".

I recall that the 2021 men’s champion was "St. George's", but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, "S. John" might have won 2021.

Let's check the 2021 season: I think "St. George's" did win in 2021. Yes, I think they did.

Thus, 2022 champion might be "St. George's".

But we need to confirm.

Let's also consider the women's champion. Historically, the women's champion has been "Saint Martin" and "St. George's" as well. In 2022, the women's champion might be "Saint Martin" or "St. George's".

Let's recall: The women's champion 2020 was "Saint Martin" (I think). In 2021, the women's champion might have been "Saint Martin" again. In 2022, maybe "Saint Martin" or "St. George's".

Let's see.

However, the question: "According to the VFL standings, which men and women teams are champion in the 2022 season?" So they want the men's champion and the women's champion.

Thus, answer: Men's champion: "St. George's" (St. George's College). Women's champion: "Saint Martin".

But I want to cross-check.

Let's search memory: "VFL Women's 2022 champion St. George's" - I think "St. George
