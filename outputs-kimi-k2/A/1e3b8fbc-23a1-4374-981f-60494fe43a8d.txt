\({ }^{1}\) Heats of explosion are calculated at constant volume, as calculated with Cheetah 4.0 (see footnote 1, Tab. 9). Values are given in calories per gram (cal/g). A-Values shown in bold (A) indicate formulations where the ingredient aluminum was used. When a material is highlighted, it indicates the color was achieved through bleaching (lightening) the natural color of the hair.

As with the total heat of combustion values, the heats of explosion are influenced by the initial color of the hair. Similar to the inverse relationship between the total heat of combustion values and lighter hair, there is an inverse relationship between heats of explosion and lighter hair tones (compare the values for light hair in Tab. 11 to the values for dark hair). There is a similar trend for the heats of explosion values calculated for the blonde hair in the heat of combustion values. That is, the heats of explosion are higher for blonde hair relative to darker hair tones. However, the effect of adding aluminum on the calculated heats of explosion values is a reduction compared to the values calculated for the systems not containing aluminum. The heats of explosion for compositions containing aluminum (indicated by the bold letter " \(A\) " after the value in the table), do not vary greatly, and they are all greater than \(1,100 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{g}\), but these values are significantly lower when compared to the heats of explosion values for the compositions not containing aluminum, and these values are greater than \(1,100 \mathrm{cal} / \mathrm{g}\). Unlike the heats of combustion, the aluminum powder reduces the energy content of the mixtures by dilution, thus the reduced values for the heats of explosion relative to the formulas without aluminum.

The calculated heats of explosion values were non-linear for some of the formulations. We attributed this to Cheetah 4.0's inability to accurately model the complex thermochemical equilibria involving the aluminum and the other formulation ingredients (i.e., AN, dextrose, hair). Despite these difficulties, the calculation of
