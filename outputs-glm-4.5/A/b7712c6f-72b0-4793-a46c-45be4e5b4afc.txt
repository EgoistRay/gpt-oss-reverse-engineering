**A. Rewrite the instructions section to be more actionable.**
**B. Rewrite the compliance statement section to be more direct and declarative.**
**C. Rewrite the entire notice to make it more reader-friendly and clearer.**
1.  **Analyze the User's Request:**
    *   **Task:** Analyze a poorly written, jargon-filled EU commission notice and rewrite it in three specific ways.
    *   **Input:** A confusing text titled "A议案.书面沟通否认 statutes 及其他" (this title itself is a likely machine translation artifact). The text discusses the European Commission's (EC) position on EU directives regarding pools, "due deference procedures," and the principle of conferral (`principe d'attribution`). It's filled with legalese, acronyms, and unclear phrasing (e.g., `点的联合读数`, `met 的义务`, `métier menés à leur parles et de manière of de la n 1169/2011`). The structure is also confusing, mixing legal arguments with a "compliance statement."
    *   **Part A: Rewrite the instructions section to be more actionable.**
        *   "Instructions section" isn't explicitly labeled. The first few paragraphs (numbered 1, 2, 3, 4) serve this purpose. They state the Commission's position and reasoning.
        *   "More actionable" implies moving from abstract legal arguments to clear guidance for stakeholders. What should someone *do* with this information? It's not about giving them tasks, but presenting the Commission's decision in a way that is easy to understand and act upon (e.g., understand the new rule, know what documents to refer to). The core action is "understand the EC's legal basis for its decision."
    *   **Part B: Rewrite the compliance statement section to be more direct and declarative.**
        *   The "compliance statement" section is the last paragraph.
        *   "Direct and declarative" means using strong, simple language. Instead of "is in accordance with," use "complies with" or "is compliant with." Instead of lengthy justifications, state the compliance clearly. Remove hedging language ("is considered," "allows," "thus"). The goal is a confident, unambiguous statement of compliance.
    *   **Part C: Rewrite the entire notice to make it more reader-friendly and clearer.**
        *   This is the main task and combines the lessons from A and B.
        *   **Identify the core message:** The European Commission is clarifying its stance on a specific EU directive (likely concerning pool safety or labeling). The Commission believes its approach, using a "due deference" procedure to add new rules in
