The code is structured modularly, with clear separation of concerns. The `DatabaseManager` handles all database operations, while the `CommandLineInterface` manages user interactions. Input validations and error handling are implemented across all user-facing functions to ensure robustness and user guidance. The use of SQLite provides a lightweight, file-based database suitable for local storage of user data.

Now, proceed to the actual code.

# Answer

**Explanation**

This Python application implements a console-based user management system with features for user registration, login, email confirmation, password reset, and logout. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

1. **Database Management**: The program uses SQLite to store user data in a table named "users". Each user has details like email, name, phone, address, password hash, confirmation status, confirmation token, and password reset token. A `DatabaseManager` class facilitates CRUD operations on this table.

2. **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 via the `hashlib` library. Each password hash includes a randomly generated salt for increased security.

3. **Token Generation**: The application uses the `secrets` module to generate cryptographically secure random tokens for email confirmation and password resets.

4. **Input Validation**:
   - **Email**: Validated with a regular expression and checked for uniqueness.
   - **Phone Number**: Must be exactly 10 digits.
   - **Password**: Must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one letter and one digit.

5. **Email Simulation**: Instead of sending real emails, the application prints the email content to the console, showing the confirmation or password reset link containing tokens.

6. **Session Management**: A `Session` object keeps track of the currently logged-in user.

7. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The user interacts with the system via a menu-driven CLI. Depending on the user's authentication status, different options are available:
   - Register, Login, Exit (if not logged in).
   - Confirm account, Reset password, Logout (if logged in).

8. **Error Handling**: The program provides informative feedback to users, ensuring a good user experience.

Below is the complete, self-contained Python code that fulfills the above functionalities. The code uses only standard library modules and can be run directly. No external dependencies are required.
