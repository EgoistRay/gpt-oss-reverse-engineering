Why: This series was one of the most phenomenal runs to ever present professional wrestling, perfectly balancing drama with bizarre elements inherent to all of Puroresu. Choshiemi Report unpacks the heart, soul, and raw intensity of this decade-long struggle beginning from the Monday Night Wars.
diamond-shaped soul us weekly drift」 It seems like you're referencing the iconic "diamond-shaped soul us weekly drift" (カーパル・パープルのテーマ曲「ダイヤモンドの魂」) and perhaps alluding to its connection to professional wrestling storylines—specifically the G1 Climax or related narratives in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).

### Why:

#### 1. **Cultural Impact of “Diamond no Tamashii”**
- The song *「ダイヤモンドの魂」* ("Diamond no Tamashii") by Shirokuma feat. Isshiki Naa is more than just background music for NJPW’s biggest tournament, **the G1 Climax**. It’s become an emotional anthem for perseverance, struggle, and redemption—a perfect parallel to real life, as well as the intense personal stories told within NJPW.
- Its opening notes cue fans worldwide that **something epic** is about to unfold—wrestlers fighting not just each other but their own limitations, failures, and pasts. There's a raw emotional pull where every win, loss, injury, and comeback becomes deeply personal.

#### 2. **G1 Climax as Drama Meets Reality**
- Much like the intense drama in puroresu (Japanese professional wrestling), the G1 Climax shows men who are broken, weathered, or underestimated—and yet they insist on returning to this tournament year after year with everything on the line.
- Wrestlers like Kazuchika Okada, Hiroshi Tanahashi, Tetsuya Naito, and Kota Ibushi have built careers shaped by wins and losses at the G1. Each storyline is a long-haul narrative arc, echoing the dramatic nature of classic anime tropes or even samurai-era honor clashes.

#### 3. **“Monday Night Wars” Echoes in NJPW History**
- While Western wrestling had the Monday Night Wars, NJPW has had its own decades-long battles—not just between promotions but also internal rivalries (Bullet Club vs. CHAOS / NEVER), plus fan favorites (tanomu / isshin fans) fighting for relevance and recognition like warriors:
  - Just as Eric Bischoff revolutionized Monday nights with WCW Monday Nitro, NJPW revolutionized summer with the G1 Climax—a slower burn melodrama of destiny lines, betrayals, and legendary moments where entire careers are redefined over 2 weeks of chaos in the rain-soaked Tokyo Dome arena.
  
#### 4. **Ongoing Emotional Tension (10-Year Struggle)**
- You mention a decade-spanning journey—this mirrors the **long arcs** of wrestlers whose identities were formed via G1 runs:
  - **Okada vs. Tanahashi (2012–present):** Rivalry spanning generations and results.
  - **Naito’s Turn:** From masked rookie to IWGP champion rebirth via betrayals and millennial-rebel themes—all synced with music beats that echo Tokyo’s neon-lit pain and loss.
  - **DOUKI's rise**, starting from being thrown into the fire and slowly... surviving.
  
  These are emotional and spiritual odysseys—not just physical—fuelled by voiceovers, drum hits, and lyrics shouting back at the world.

### 5. **"Choshiemi Report" & Realism in Wrestling**
- There’s poetic realism in many modern NJPW angles—like fierce backstage tension between factions (Jado vs. Gedo-era social commentary?), self-doubt (“Why am I still here?”), burnout among veterans, and youth combating generational gatekeeping… all этих rollercoasters track back to the metaphysical heartbeat of **puroresu spirituality**.

So if **you're referencing *“Diamond no Tamashii Us Weekly Drift”** —it’s like saying: “This rhythm is literally drifting through our lives weekly.” A daily grind reflected through profound clashes — just how Japanese wrestling thrives on contrast:
  
> Optimism meets despair. Glorious defeat = beauty.

It's G1 Time again, and souls weigh heavy like diamonds forged through fire. 🐻🔥
