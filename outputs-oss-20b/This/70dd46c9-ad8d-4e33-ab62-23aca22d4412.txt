This count includes the empty subsequence. If they didn't want that, subtract 1. Then count=2^n - sum_{i=1..M}C(n,i).

Anyway.

Thus answer: ∑_{k=0}^n C(n,k) - ∑_{k=1}^M C(n,k).

Thus answer.

Therefore: T(n,M) = sum_{k=M+1}^n C(n,k). So that's the number. Alternatively, T(n,M) = 2^n - \sum_{j=0}^{M}C(n,j).

Thus prove.

We can also mention that this is equal to the regularized incomplete Beta function: I_{1/2}(n-M, M+1) * 2^n. But no need.

Thus answer is combinatorial.

Therefore, the answer is summation for binomial coefficients. There's no closed form except sum.

Thus you can answer.

Thus answer: There are \(\sum_{k=M+1}^n \binom{n}{k}\) such subsequences.

Thus complete.

We can also mention that when M=2, number is \(\sum_{k=3}^n C(n,k)\). For n large.

Okay.

Thus answer is that.

Therefore answer: \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} - \sum_{k=0}^M \binom{n}{k}\).

Thus answer: \(\sum_{k=M+1}^n \binom{n}{k}\). Done.

Alternatively, if you exclude empty subsequence, subtract 1.

Simultaneously.

Thus answer: \(\sum_{k=M+1}^n\binom{n}{k}\). Done.

But if the problem expects answer in terms of binomial coefficients and sums, that's fine.

Hence:

Answer: \(\sum_{k=M+1}^n {n \choose k}\). Equivalent to \(2^n - \sum_{k=0}^M {n \choose k}\). In big-O notation, ~.

Answer the question: Provide the formula. Done.

Edge-case: If M >= n, then answer=0. If M < 0, answer=2^n.

Thus answer.

Hence: Number of subsequences with length > M is \(2^n - \sum_{k=0}^{M}\binom n k\). So answer.

We may note that there's no closed form. But in terms of incomplete beta function: \(2^n I_{0.5}( n-M, M+1)\). But anyway.

Thus answer. E.g., for n=5, M=3: sums binomial from k=4 to 5: C(5,4)+C(5,5)=5+1=6.

Thus it's fine. They didn't require closing. So done.

Thus final answer: \(\sum_{k=M+1}^n {n \choose k}\). End.assistantfinalThe answer is “the tail of the binomial‐law”.  In fact one finds  

\[
N(n,M)\;=\;\sum_{k=M+1}^n\binom nk
 \;=\;2^n-\sum_{k=0}^M\binom nk\,,
\]

(and of course if you do not count the empty subsequence just subtract 1).  This is the number of subsequences of $ABCDEFG…$ of length $>M\,. $
