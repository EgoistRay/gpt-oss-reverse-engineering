How does the structure of the graph $\G$ affect the solutions to the HJB equation \eqref{eq:HJBE} and the optimal control? In particular, can you give an example where the graph has multiple vertices and nontrivial dynamics and explain how the optimal control would be determined across different segments of the graph?" 

This is a question about how graph structure influences solutions to HJB equations and optimal control. The question asks for a specific example where graph has multiple vertices and non-trivial dynamics.

The HJB equation \eqref{eq:HJBE} is presumably something like $\lambda u(x) - \mathcal{H}(x, Du(x)) = 0$ where $\mathcal{H}(x,p) = -\min_{a \in A} \{ f(x,a) \cdot p + l(x,a) \}$ for some dynamics $f(x,a)$ and cost $l$.

Graph $\G$ consists of edges and vertices; at vertices, the dynamics may change, or control may be restricted. Solutions to HJB equation on graphs involve boundary conditions at vertices and conditions for matching solutions across edges. The structure of graph (number of vertices, connectivity, weights on edges etc.) influences existence of multiple possible control paths, and the optimal control may involve switching between controls when at vertices or when crossing edges.

Thus the answer should discuss: the HJB equation on each edge has solutions depending on the local dynamics; at each vertex, one must impose junction conditions. The optimal control might require solving for each edge separately, then matching them at vertices via appropriate boundary conditions. The graph structure may produce multiple possible optimal trajectories, with the optimum determined by the global minimization of cost. The graph may have multiple vertices connected by edges. Each edge may have a different dynamic f_e(x,a) and cost l_e(x,a). The optimal control is piecewise defined: on each edge, choose control that solves the HJB locally; at each vertex, decide which edge to take next. This decision will involve comparing cost-to-go values and switching functions. In an example, you could have a graph with vertices V1, V2, V3; edges e1 connecting V1->V2, e2 connecting V2->V3. The control on e1 might be to accelerate, while on e2 might be to decelerate. One might choose to go through V2 or avoid it if there's a shortcut.

We should give a concrete example: suppose you have a graph with vertices A, B, C, edges AB, BC, AC. The dynamics on AB are f_AB(x,a) = a, cost l_AB(x,a) = a^2. On BC, dynamics f_BC(x,a) = a, cost l_BC(x,a) = a^2 + 1. On AC, dynamics f_AC(x,a) = a, cost l_AC(x,a) = a^2 - 0.5. The goal is to go from A to C. The HJB equation on each edge is: $\lambda u(x) + f(x,a)\cdot u'(x) + l(x,a) = 0$ with minimization over a. On each edge, the optimal a is such that $u'(x) = 0$ or something like that. The optimal control on each edge will be constant or zero. At the vertex B, we must choose between continuing on BC or going to AC. The solution will be determined by comparing the value functions at B.

Thus the structure of graph influences whether the optimal path uses certain vertices or edges, which influences the optimal control across segments.

Also, mention that at a vertex, the value function must satisfy a compatibility condition: the maximum of value from adjacent edges equals the value at vertex. The optimal control may involve switching between edges.

Thus a typical answer would discuss that the graph's connectivity yields multiple optimal trajectories, and the control is piecewise defined across edges, with switching conditions at vertices.

We could mention that the HJB equations on each edge are solved with boundary conditions at vertices. The graph structure might yield multiple solutions or require a selection principle.

In the specific example, consider two edges connected at a vertex. One could have one edge with dynamics $f_1(x,a)=a$ and cost $l_1(x,a)=x^2$; the other with $f_2(x,a)= -a$ and cost $l_2(x,a)= (1-x)^2$. The optimal control will be chosen to minimize cost-to-go. At the vertex, the control must satisfy a junction condition: the derivative of the value function from each side must match.

In summary: The graph structure can cause non-smoothness in solutions, requires matching conditions at vertices, and influences the optimal switching between edges. The example with multi-vertex graph demonstrates how the local HJB
