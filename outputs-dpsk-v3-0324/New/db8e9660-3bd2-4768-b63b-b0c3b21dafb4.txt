Newborn deaths, caused by being deprived of oxygen during delivery, could be drastically cut if midwives around the world reverse babies from their current head-up position to a head-down position just weeks before they are due, new research shows.

Doing so decreases the chances of the baby having to be delivered by caesarean section, as well as bringing down the costs of medical procedures in poorer countries.

But very few midwives internationally are currently performing the procedure known as an ECV (external cephalic version), which involves moving the unborn baby from a breech (head-up) to a cephalic (head-down) position by applying gentle pressure to the mother's abdomen.

The study, published in the journal Health Technology Assessment from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and led by the University of East Anglia (UEA), was conducted in the UK, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda, Ghana and India.

Some 387 providers of childbirth services, including midwives, doctors and obstetricians, in cities and rural areas completed an online survey, with researchers also conducting 21 detailed interviews. The researchers also interviewed 13 pregnant women and held focus groups with 12 others.

Lead researcher Dr Elaine Burns, from UEA's School of Health Sciences, said: "We wanted to examine the barriers to midwives performing external cephalic version (ECV) by talking to midwives and others involved in childbirth internationally.
