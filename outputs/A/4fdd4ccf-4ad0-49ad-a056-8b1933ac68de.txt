A1, C1, D1). So we have a 2x2 block. But we also have A4 and C4 etc. But these are part of same block? Let's analyze: B4 is at (4,6). So A4 (row 4) is in block 2? Let's compute block index: For B4, i = 4, which belongs to block 2 because block boundaries: (1-3) block 0, (4-6) block 1? Actually 4 lies in block 1 (block index 1). So A4 belongs to block 1. So A4 is not part of the block with B1 (block 0). So we have separate blocks: block 0 (rows 1-3), block 1 (rows 4-6), block 2 (rows 7-9), block 3 (rows 10-12). Similarly for columns. So there will be 4 blocks of 3x3 each. For each B_i, the corresponding A_j's in same block will have non-zero. So we need to compute block wise.

Thus we can treat each 3x3 block separately: For each block r (0 to 3), we have 3 rows r*3+1 .. r*3+3 of the matrix A; there might be 3 columns per block too? Actually B_i is 3 rows, 3 columns. So for each block, we have 3 columns (3x3 submatrix). So we can compute each block's determinant as product of the three diagonal blocks? Let's analyze.

Let B be 12x3 matrix with 12 rows and 3 columns. B is comprised of 4 block matrices B_i each 3x3. Suppose we reorder columns of A accordingly: A's 12x12 matrix can be partitioned into 12 columns as well. We need to match each block B_i to A block.

Let's define the index mapping: For each block i, the columns of B_i are from 3i+1 to 3i+3. For each B_i, we need to compute the block of A that multiplies B_i.

We can reorder columns of A to group them by block. Let's reorder A columns so that they group by B block: columns for block 0: columns 1-3; block 1: columns 4-6; block 2: columns 7-9; block 3: columns 10-12. Similarly reorder rows maybe? But we can reorder rows of A to correspond with B block. B has rows grouped by i=0..3: rows 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12. So reorder rows of A by same grouping. After row permutation and column permutation, the matrix will have block structure: A becomes block upper-triangular? Let's examine pattern: The non-zero entries of A at positions where row block = column block (i.e., i==j) are non-zero. The entries where row block = column block + 1 are also non-zero. And all other entries zero. So A becomes a block-banded matrix with block structure where blocks along diagonal are A_i (size 3x3) and subdiagonal block below diag is C_i (size 3x3). So after reordering rows and columns, A becomes block-tridiagonal with 4 block rows and 4 block columns: diag blocks at (1,1) = A_0, (2,2) = A_1, (3,3) = A_2, (4,4) = A_3. Subdiagonal blocks at (2,1) = C_0, (3,2) = C_1, (4,3) = C_2. Upper diag blocks all zeros. So A is block-lower-triangular? Wait subdiagonal is below diagonal: (2,1) is below diag; (3,2) below diag; (4,3) below diag. So A is block lower-triangular? Actually lower triangular would have all blocks below diag maybe but we also have diag blocks. This matrix is lower block triangular? Let's analyze: A after reordering: For block 1 row, columns 1-3: we have A_0 diag; columns 4-6: zero; columns 7-9: zero; columns 10-12: zero. Row 2 (rows 4-6): columns 1-3: C_0 (non-zero), columns 4-6: A_1, columns 7-9: zero, columns 10-12: zero. Row 3 (rows 7-9): columns 1-3: zero,
