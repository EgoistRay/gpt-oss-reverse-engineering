How & Why" class with Bryan Fox was a standout. It was cool to hear the story of how he got to this point in his career, from moving to Tahoe to quitting his job at the casino, filming with Absinthe and the Powder & Rails guys at Forum and having a group of homies all stoked on snowboarding. Yet, to me, something that stuck out most was Bryan's thoughtfulness and the value of creating something meaningful. Not just "Here's my part, I'm the shit", but the cohesiveness and taking care of the people around you. Snowboarding and the environment we create around it, that's what'll last.

Surprisingly, X Games taught me about the importance of a crew, of a solid group of homies you can count on. Find those people that share the same passion as you, lift each other up, and there's a bond that can't be broken between people who share the pure passion for snowboarding. It was epic seeing how little Judelyn and Kadence were hanging out with Brenna and Darrah. At such young age, they just see it as "We're all here because we love snowboarding" and value and realize the opportunity they have of getting to hang out with and just learn from these women that have been doing it for so long. Like yeah, they rip— but it's so much more than that.

Three years later, at 18, I'm sitting on a plane headed to X Games Butter Event. I've learned that these athletes aren't untouchable legends; they're people who love snowboarding just like the rest of us. I’ve seen people not take advantage of the opportunities and I've seen others turn nothing into everything. What really stuck with me? The crew you surround yourself with makes all the difference. Those people you're filming with, traveling with, sending it with, that see potential in you long before you've proven anything— those are the ones who make snowboarding what it is. When you have people backing you and believing in your vision, that collective energy is what pushes everything forward. That, more than anything, is what I'll carry with me. The footage, the photos, the moments— those are sick, but that support and motivation from your crew? That's the real fuel. Everything else falls into place when you’ve got good people around you who genuinely care. That spirit of building each other up, how it extends beyond who you are now to who you want to be. That's the kind of momentum that never stops growing. When you're surrounded by good people who motivate you, that energy is something you can carry with you forever.

Bring a crew and get after it. Thanks for everything, X Games.

Thanks to all the people who took a chance on me. Mad love to my friends, Kelsey Manning, Sarah Hill, Snowboarder Magazine, Drew Hastings, and everyone else involved for making this happen, plus Nicky for the amazing snowboarding photos. These moments have shaped who I am today, pushing me to keep chasing whatever comes next. Love y’all.

To many more snowy days, crispy turns, and beautiful mellow people. Can’t wait for what’s next. Much love.

Catch ya on the next one. ✌️

I was listening to Lean In – Sheryl Sandberg’s book – on a recent hike around Crater Lake. Remote camping, little sleep, sore feet, and a long gaze at the horizon gave me all these wild thoughts. This chapter struck me: “Sit at the Table.” She talks about how many women – even when invited – hesitate to take a seat because they’re waiting for their moment, waiting to feel qualified, waiting until everyone else sits down. It clicked.

Snowboarding has this magical thing where terrain evolves – fresh tracks, weather windows, and snow depth decide what’s rideable. It changes every single day. Same goes for opportunities in life. They’re not going to wait for you to “feel ready.” Sometimes you just gotta take the first chair up the mountain and figure it out.

My 15-year-old self would never have pictured this. She would have found it hard to believe that I’m here, creating this blog about something that started from scratch. Back then, it was just forums, scoping Photoshop tutorials, and doing anything possible to find my path. No clear direction, no set plan – just a drive to take action. It’s been far from easy, yet every dung jank situation has led to something greater. From early days of me Go
