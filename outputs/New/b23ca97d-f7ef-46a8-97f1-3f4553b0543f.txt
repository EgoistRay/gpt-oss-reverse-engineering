New` is set to the first element of the array `a`. This might not be the most efficient way to write this. Usually, you'd write something like `if (!listNew) { listNew = a[0]; }`. The current code works but could be written more clearly.

Line 18-19: `if (list.length > 0 && list[0] !== listNew) { list.unshift(listNew); }`
- This checks if `list` has elements (length > 0) and if the first element of `list` is not equal to `listNew`. If this condition is true, it prepends `listNew` to `list`. 
- This seems to be ensuring that `list[0]` is `listNew`. If `list[0]` is not `listNew`, it adds `listNew` to the beginning of `list`.

Line 20-22: `if (!list.length) { list.push(listNew); }`
- If `list` is empty, it pushes `listNew` into `list`. This ensures that `list` has at least one element, which would be `listNew`.

At this point, `list` is guaranteed to have `listNew` as its first element, and possibly other elements after it.

Line 24: `let result = '';`
- This initializes a variable `result` to an empty string. This will likely be used to build the output string.

Line 25: `list.forEach((a, i) => {`
- This begins a loop over each element in `list`. For each element, it will refer to the element as `a`, and `i` will be the index of that element in `list`.

Line 26-27: `if(a === undefined || a === null) { a = ''; }`
- This checks if `a` is `undefined` or `null`. If it is, it sets `a` to an empty string. This means that later code can safely assume that `a` is a string and not `undefined` or `null`.

Line 28: `let b = 0;`
- This initializes a variable `b` to 0. This variable might be used as a counter or index for something.

Line 29: `if (a.length > 0) {`
- This checks if the string `a` has a length greater than 0, which means it is not an empty string.

Line 30-32: `if (i === 0 && typeof list.length === 'number' && list.length > 0) { if (result.length) { result = result.replace(/([0-9])(\d)/, '$1 $2'); } }`
- This code only runs if we are on the first element of `list` (`i === 0`). It's a bit confusing because `typeof list.length === 'number'` is always true for an array. The condition `list.length > 0` is also always true at this point because we just ensured that `list` has at least one element. So essentially, this block runs if we're processing the first element of `list`.
- Inside this block, it checks if `result.length` is truthy (i.e., if `result` is not an empty string). If `result` has a length, it applies a replace operation on `result`: it replaces a regex `/([0-9])(\d)/` with `'$1 $2'`. This regex seems to match two consecutive digits, and it's replacing them with the first digit, a space, and the second digit. This could be a way of adding a space between a number and the next digit if they were concatenated together. For example, if "123" was in `result`, it might turn it into "1 23" if it matched. However, this replace might only match the first occurrence of two consecutive digits. Let's keep this in mind. This could also be a typo or bug, because this replace would affect the entire `result` string, which might not be what is intended. 

After looking at it again, I think I misinterpreted something. This `if (i === 0 ...)` block only runs when we're processing the first element of `list`, and it only does something if `result` already has something in it. But we haven't added anything to `result` before this point because this is the first element of the loop. So `result` would normally be empty here, which means `result.replace...` would not do anything. I'm a bit confused about the purpose of this block. Maybe it's meant to handle a special case where `list` has more than one element and we are starting with the first one? Let's keep going.
