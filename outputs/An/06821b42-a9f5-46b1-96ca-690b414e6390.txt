An essential consideration is ensuring that the total sum of probabilities over all states at time t is 1. This property is preserved by the recursive formula because the sum over i of the transition probabilities p_{ji}(t) for any fixed j is 1:

∑_{i} p_{ji}(t) = 1.

Thus, at time t+1:

∑_{i} p_i(t+1) = ∑_{i} [∑_{j} p_i(t) × p_{ji}(t)] = ∑_{j} p_i(t) × [∑_{i} p_{ji}(t)] = ∑_{j} p_i(t) × 1 = ∑_{j} p_i(t) = 1, assuming the sum at time t is 1.

Therefore, the normalization is preserved by this process.

An important implication is that the distribution p_i(t) converges as t becomes large, potentially to a stationary distribution under certain conditions.

Moreover, from a computational point of view, this formula allows for efficient calculation of state probabilities across time. However, the computational cost can become significant if the number of states is large, necessitating efficient implementations, possibly utilizing sparse matrix representations or other optimizations.

In the context of this article, the authors are applying this methodology to a particular problem: modeling the dynamics of a system that can undergo multiple types of transformations (e.g., DNA mutations). At each time step, the system can transition between different states, with probabilities governed by the nature of the mutations.

The authors use the formula p_i(t+1) = ∑_{j} p_i(t) × p_{ji} as part of a recursive approach to compute the probabilities of the system being in any particular state after N transformations. Moreover, they discuss efficient ways to compute this, particularly using properties of the transition probabilities.

From a practical perspective, the method is applied to problems such as predicting the frequency of certain sequences or structures in biological contexts, where the combinatorial complexity of the state space (e.g., all possible DNA sequences of a given length) is enormous.

The recursive nature of the probability calculation aligns well with iterative numerical methods or dynamic programming strategies, which are well-suited for large-scale problems.

In terms of the derivation and proof of this formula, it follows directly from the basic principles of probability theory and the law of total probability, as detailed above.

To further analyze the implications and practical use, let's consider a specific example.

Suppose we have a Markov chain with n states, S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, and the transition probability matrix is given by P = [p_{ij}]. At time t=0, we have an initial distribution p_i(0). Then, the distribution at time t is given by:

p_i(t) = [P^t]_{ij} × p_j(0), summing over j.

But computing matrix powers can be computationally intensive for large t and large state spaces.

Alternatively, using the recursive formula, we can iteratively compute p_i(t+1) from p_i(t) via:

p_i(t+1) = ∑_{j} p_j(t) × p_{ji}.

This approach can be more efficient, especially if the transition matrix is sparse or has special structure.

In the specific context of the article, the state space corresponds to certain biological or chemical transformations, and the transitions represent the likelihoods of different types of mutations or transformations.

Therefore, the formula p_i(t+1) = ∑_{j} p_i(t) × p_{ji} serves as a computational tool for predicting the distribution over states after successive transformations.

Moreover, if we consider the case where the transition probabilities are fixed and do not change over time—that is, p_{ji} depends only on states i and j, not on time t—then P remains constant over time, and the system eventually converges to a stationary distribution π, satisfying π = π P.

In more complex settings, where transition probabilities vary with time or depend on other factors, the recursive approach allows dynamic adjustment and calculation of distributions at each time point.

Now, let's consider possible challenges and assumptions in this approach.

Firstly, the Markov assumption implies that the future state depends only on the current state. In real biological systems, this may not hold if prior history or other factors influence the transitions.

Secondly, computing probabilities for all states may be infeasible if the state space is huge. Therefore, one may need to approximate or sample.

Thirdly, if transition probabilities are not known precisely, uncertainty needs to be managed. Bayesian methods or parameter estimation techniques may be necessary.

Fourthly, the method assumes that the probabilities can be accurately represented numerically, but in practice, rounding errors may accumulate over many time steps.

Now, in the context of the article, the authors likely address
