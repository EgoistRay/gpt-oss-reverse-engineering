The 'Add Category' and 'Add Sub-Feature' functionalities will add new items to the tree.

The 'Save' button will serialize the tree into a JSON structure and send it via POST to '/update-structure', then handle response accordingly.

We need to ensure appropriate event handling for editing in-place (i.e., making labels editable). For that, we can use contentEditable for labels, or create a separate form for editing.

For making the tree interactive, we need to provide:

- expand/collapse

- drag-and-drop to reorder and nest

- editing labels

- delete

We need to ensure that the UI is intuitive for users.

Now, in the code, we need to:

1. Include necessary CSS and JS libraries via CDN.

2. Implement the HTML structure: a container for the tree, a set of control buttons for 'Add Category', 'Add Sub-Feature', 'Save', 'Cancel', etc.

3. JavaScript code to initialize the tree with the initial data, configure jsTree with the necessary plugins (e.g., contextmenu for delete, types for allowed nodes, etc.).

4. Implement event handlers:

   - For node selection: display 'Edit / Delete' options.

   - For editing labels: when editing is confirmed (e.g., on blur or enter key), update the node's label.

   - For delete: remove node and its descendants.

   - For 'Add Category' or 'Add Sub-Feature': add new node under the selected node.

5. Implement 'Save' functionality: get the tree data as JSON, send it to the server via ajax POST.

6. Handle 'Cancel': revert the tree to the initial data.

7. Optionally, implement 'Undo'/'Redo' using a history stack that records changes to the tree.

Now, proceeding to write the code accordingly.

# Answer

To solve the problem of developing a dynamic, client-side web interface for managing a hierarchical structure, we will use a combination of the following technologies:

- **jQuery**: A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and Ajax interactions.
- **jsTree**: A jQuery plugin that provides interactive trees with a variety of features like drag-and-drop, node editing, and more.

Here's how we'll approach the solution:

1. **HTML Structure**: We'll set up a basic HTML structure that includes a container for the tree and UI controls like buttons for adding categories, sub-features, editing entries, deleting entries, saving changes, and canceling edits.

2. **CSS Styling**: We'll use Bootstrap for styling. It provides a responsive grid system and pre-defined components that can help in creating an intuitive UI.

3. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - **Data Initialization**: We'll initialize the tree with the provided JSON data.
   - **Tree Operations**:
     - **Add Category**: Adds a new category at the root level.
     - **Add Sub-Feature**: Adds a sub-feature under the selected node.
     - **Edit Entry**: Allows inline editing of node names.
     - **Delete Entry**: Removes a node and its descendants from the tree.
     - **Save Changes**: Serializes the tree to JSON and sends it to the server via an Ajax POST request.
     - **Cancel**: Reverts any unsaved changes by reloading the initial data.
   - **Event Handling**: We'll set up listeners for node selection, editing, addition, deletion, and button clicks to handle the respective functionalities.

4. **Server Interaction**: A mock Ajax function will simulate server interactions for saving and updating data. This function mimics a server that responds with success or failure.

Now, let's dive into the actual implementation:
