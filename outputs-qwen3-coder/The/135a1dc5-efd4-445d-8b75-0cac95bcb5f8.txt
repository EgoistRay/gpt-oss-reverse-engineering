The following Premises: A ⇒ (B ⇒ C), (A ∧ B) ⇒ (D ∧ C), A, B  what is the conclusion? Use direct proof. To find the conclusion using a direct proof, we'll systematically apply the given premises and logical rules to derive the final statement.

### Given Premises:
1. **A ⇒ (B ⇒ C)**  
2. **(A ∧ B) ⇒ (D ∧ C)**  
3. **A**  
4. **B**

### Goal:
Derive a conclusion from these premises using direct proof.

---

### Step-by-Step Proof:

**Step 1:** From premise 3, we have **A**.

**Step 2:** From premise 4, we have **B**.

**Step 3:** Since we have both **A** and **B**, we can form the conjunction:
\[
A \land B
\]

**Step 4:** Using premise 2, **(A ∧ B) ⇒ (D ∧ C)**, and the fact that **A ∧ B** is true (from Step 3), we can apply **Modus Ponens**:
\[
D \land C
\]

**Step 5:** From **D ∧ C**, we can conclude:
\[
C
\]
(Using simplification)

---

### Final Conclusion:
The conclusion is **C**. 

This follows directly from the premises and logical rules.
