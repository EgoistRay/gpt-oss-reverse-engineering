In terms of the 'be light on mockups', we can assume that the data is available and perhaps use placeholders where necessary.

I'll proceed and write the code accordingly.

But first, think about data.

Assuming we have a DataFrame with:

- 'customer_id' : unique identifier

- 'customer_segment' : e.g., 'Low', 'Mid', 'High'

- 'purchases' : vector of total purchases per month over 12 months.

Alternatively, each month could be a column 'm1', 'm2', ..., 'm12', with the purchase amount.

Similarly, data per customer: a row with these values.

First, the code will read in the data (assumed pre-existing DataFrame), select a 'customer_segment' of interest (say, 'High'), and extract their purchase time series.

Then compute the mean purchase per month across all customers in that segment.

Plot the mean purchase per month, with error bars.

Compute the 'slope' of the trend, perhaps via linear regression.

Compute mean square of the slope and mean purchase.

Compute the 'slope significance' perhaps analogously to the 'slopethresh' in the original code.

Compute 'r_squared' per customer.

Plot histogram of the slope significance.

Plot the mean purchase with error bars.

Plot mean r_squared.

Given that, I'll write code accordingly.

Details such as code for linear regression for each customer, calculation of slope and r_squared per customer.

Similarly, code for plotting.

I'll import necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.linear_model.

Proceed to write code accordingly.

Remember, only output the single code file, and nothing else.

Let's proceed.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Assuming 'customer_data' is a pre-loaded DataFrame with the following columns:
# 'customer_id'       : Unique identifier for each customer
# 'customer_segment'  : Categorical variable indicating customer segment (e.g., 'Low', 'Mid', 'High')
# 'm1', 'm2', ..., 'm12' : Purchase amounts for months 1 through 12

# For the purpose of this code, let's create a mock DataFrame with sample data
# This is just placeholder data for demonstration purposes
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducible results

num_customers = 200
months = ['m{}'.format(i) for i in range(1, 13)]
segments = ['Low', 'Mid', 'High']

data_list = []
for i in range(num_customers):
    segment = np.random.choice(segments, p=[0.3, 0.4, 0.3])  # Probabilities can be adjusted
    purchases = np.abs(np.random.normal(loc=1000 if segment=='High' else 500, scale=200, size=12))
    customer_dict = {
        'customer_id': i,
        'customer_segment': segment
    }
    customer_dict.update(dict(zip(months, purchases)))
    data_list.append(customer_dict)

customer_data = pd.DataFrame(data_list)

# Define whether to include only customers with sufficient data (e.g., all 12 months)
include_all_months = True

# 1. Selecting the Customer Segment
segment_of_interest = 'High'
segment_data = customer_data[customer_data['customer_segment'] == segment_of_interest]

# 2. Handling Missing Data
if include_all_months:
    # Ensure all months are present; drop if any missing
    segment_data = segment_data.dropna(subset=months)
else:
    # Include customers even if they have some missing months
    segment_data = segment_data.copy()

# 3. Computing Per-Customer Metrics
# For each customer, compute:
# - Slope and R-squared of purchase trend over time
# - Mean purchase amount over the year
customer_metrics = []
for idx, row in segment_data.iterrows():
    y = row[months].values.reshape(-1, 1)  # Purchase amounts
    X = np.arange(1, 13).reshape(-1, 1)    # Months (1-12)
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    slope = model.coef_[0][0]
    r_squared = model.score(X, y)
    mean_purchase = np.mean(y)
    customer_metrics.append({
        'customer_id': row['customer_id'],
        'slope': slope,
        'r_squared': r_squared,
        'mean_purchase': mean_purchase
    })

metrics_df = pd.DataFrame(customer_metrics)

# 4. Calculating Statistical Measures
# Slope Variance
slope_variance = np.mean(metrics_df['slope'] **
