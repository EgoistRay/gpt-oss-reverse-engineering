A\) is an element of the set of 1-dimensional subspaces (projective points) in \(E\). Then, for a set \(B \subseteq A\), the set \(\operatorname{span} B\) is the subspace generated by all vectors in \(\bigcup_{a \in B} a\). That is, the set of all finite linear combinations of vectors that are in the subspaces \(a\) for \(a \in B\).

Thus, if \(\operatorname{span}B = E\), i.e., the subspace generated by the vectors in the subspaces in \(B\) is the whole space \(E\), then \(\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{span} B = n\), which is the dimension of \(E\). Therefore, \(|B| = \operatorname{dim} \operatorname{span} B = n\).

Now, the claim is that in this case, \(B\) must be a basis of \(E\). Indeed, since each element of \(B\) is a projective point—i.e., a 1-dimensional subspace, i.e., a line through the origin—then each such subspace contains a nonzero vector. So, pick one nonzero vector from each such subspace.

Then, these \(n\) vectors are each in a different subspace (since \(B\) is a set of distinct projective points), so they are linearly independent, because they belong to distinct 1-dimensional subspaces.

Moreover, they generate the whole space, since the subspace generated by these vectors is all of \(E\). Therefore, these \(n\) vectors form a basis of \(E\), and the subspaces in \(B\) are precisely the lines spanned by these basis vectors.

Therefore, \(B\) contains the set of all lines of the basis vectors.

Now, for the converse, suppose \(B\) is an element of \(\mathscr{B}^{*}\), that is, a basis \(B = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, ..., a_{n}\}\), where each \(a_{i}\) is a 1-dimensional subspace (i.e., a line). Then each \(a_{i} = K e_{i}\), where \(e_{i}\) is a basis vector.

Thus, \(A = \{ K e_{1}, K e_{2}, ..., K e_{n} \} \subseteq \bigcup_{\beta \in B} \beta \) — perhaps meaning that \(A\) is a subset of the union over \(\beta \in B\) of \(\beta\), though I suspect this notation is not precise.

In any case, since the set \(\{e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n}\}\) spans \(E\), and \(e_{i} \in K e_{i}\), for each \(i\), we can find \(e_{i} \in K e_{i} \in B\). Hence, \(\operatorname{span} B = \operatorname{span} \{ e_{1}, e_{2}, ..., e_{n} \} = E\).

Therefore, this completes the proof.

But now, let's think more carefully about this lemma.

First, let's restate the lemma:

Let \(E\) be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field \(K\), and let \(\mathscr{B}^{*}\) be the set of all bases of \(E\) considered as sets of 1-dimensional subspaces (i.e., the set of all bases of \(E\) where each basis element is a line).

Define \(\operatorname{span} B\) as the subspace generated by all vectors in \(\bigcup_{a \in B} a\), i.e., the smallest subspace of \(E\) containing all vectors in all 1-dimensional subspaces in \(B\).

Lemma: \(B \subseteq A\) (that is, \(B\) a subset of the set of all 1-dimensional subspaces in \(E\)) is an element of \(\mathscr{B}^{*}\) if and only if \(\operatorname{dim} \operatorname{span} B = |B| = n\), where \(n = \dim E\).

In other words, the set \(B\) of 1-dimensional subspaces is a basis of \(E\) if and only if the subspace they generate has dimension \(n\), equal to the number of such subspaces.

Ok, let's examine the proof and implications.

In the forward direction: Suppose \(B\) is a basis of \(
