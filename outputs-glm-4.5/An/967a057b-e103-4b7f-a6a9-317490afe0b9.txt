AnTranslated by Anna Poch. A first release from Barcelona-based publisher Pol·len Edicions, and winner of the European Prize for Literature, this novel is told in three parts, each from the perspective of a different narrator. The first is a teacher who makes the trip from Barcelona to Berlin in the winter, and contracts a mysterious illness that puts him in the hospital for months, alienated and unable to communicate. The second narrator is a scientist trying to develop a drug that will erase painful memories, who tests it on himself. The third is a woman who has lost her lover to the drug developed in the second part, spending her days at his bedside. Part science fiction, part psychological thriller, the novel is surreal, disturbing, and beautifully written.

Won’t it freeze at the slightest sign of cold?”
“Anna’s gaze never wavers: ‘So what if it freezes? Maybe it’s worth it for that one moment, maybe it’s worth it to see 
“Anna’s gaze never wavers: ‘So what if it freezes? Maybe it’s worth it for that one moment, maybe it’s worth it to see the flower just for an instant, even though it knows what’s coming, even though it knows it’s going to disappear. Don’t you think?”
That answer is like a slap. Or a caress.
Like something sharp and pointed that you work onto a piece of calloused skin until you can feel yourself starting to bleed.”

This book is without a doubt one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
Transcendentally lyrical, haunting in its despondency; this novel is a swirling miasma of desire and sorrow.

But I am ALIVE.
I am more sure of my own existence after reading this book than I have been in a very long time.
Read. This. Book.

I feel so incompetent right now.
How is it even possible to write a review that will do this novel even a modicum of justice?
I don’t think it can be done.
And I know I will fail.
But here goes nothing.
