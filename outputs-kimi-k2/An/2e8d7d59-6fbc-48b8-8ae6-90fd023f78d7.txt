An algebraic identity (Polynomial Identity) is an equality that is true for all values of the variables in mathematics. An identity is true for any value of the variable, whereas an equation is true for only certain values of the variable.

**Basic Algebraic Identities**

The following are the four basic algebraic identities:

1. **(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²** (plus whole square)
2. **(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²** (minus whole square)
3. **a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)** (square minus)
4. **(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc** (three variables)

**Extended Algebraic Identities**

Other useful identities include:

1. **(a + b)³ = a³ + b³ + 3ab(a + b)** (plus whole cube)
2. **(a - b)³ = a³ - b³ - 3ab(a - b)** (minus whole cube)
3. **a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)** (cube plus)
4. **a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)** (cube minus)

**Factorization Using Algebraic Identities**

Algebraic identities can be used for factorization. For example:

* Example 1: Solve **49x² - 9**.
  * Solution: Using the identity **a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)**, we get:
  * **49x² - 9 = (7x)² - 3² = (7x + 3)(7x - 3)**
* Example 2: Solve **x² - 4x + 4**.
  * Solution: Using the identity **(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²**, we get:
  * **x² - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)²**

**Elaborated Algebraic Identities**

Some more examples of algebraic identities are:

* **a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - ac - bc)**
* **n(n + 1)(n + 2) = n³ + 3n² + 2n**
* **n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3) = n⁴ + 6n³ + 11n² + 6n**
