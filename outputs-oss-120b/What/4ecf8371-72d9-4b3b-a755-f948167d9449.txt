What could cause this discrepancy?

First, having local: true ensures the form is submitted via the standard HTTP request.

But the problem could be as follows:

- The form is there, with the correct action, methods, CSRF tokens, etc.

- After clicking "login", the user is taken to the expected URL (in address bar) but the page content corresponds to the user show page.

Possibility:

- There's a redirect after login to the user show page (or something similar), but the view displayed is that of the login page (or the 'new session').

Note that checking the Rails logs (development log) would be ideal to see which controller actions were called, and what the response was.

But given the problem description, perhaps the form is not being submitted correctly. For instance, perhaps the form is being submitted via a get request, or perhaps the CSRF token is missing.

But given that the form uses standard form_tag helper methods, and it's not using Ajax. So let's think.

Potential causes:

1) The form's action URL is pointing not to the sessions#create, which would be the standard route for creating sessions (i.e., logging in). Maybe it's pointing elsewhere.

2) The form has a method that is not matching the route.

3) CSRF token is missing or invalid.

4) There's an issue where the controller action is not being handled correctly: perhaps the sessions controller's 'create' action is responding incorrectly (i.e., rendering a page when it's supposed to redirect).

But the observation is that the controller (deletmerchant ...) 'gets the request and returns the correct render', but the page doesn't change its content.

Could the problem be that the response is being rendered inside a remote form?

But 'local: true' is used, and the form is built with standard Rails form_tag.

However, perhaps the form is being generated inside an 'iframe' tag, or something similar?

Alternatively, is there a misconfiguration in the way authentication is done? For instance, Devise's login flow.

But more importantly, the issue is that he sees an 'Number of Users: 2' text that appears before the request appears.

Does that mean that the login page is being rendered prior to any request (obviously), and the content after login is the same, i.e., the page does not reflect the logged-in user context.

Further, as per the description, after clicking the password field and then login button, the page updates the address.

Now that brings up the pattern: sometimes the login form reacts to entering password field (or clicking, or after setTimeOut), perhaps there's some JavaScript that triggers.

But in the problem, the dev says the page uses local form.

Now, the Rails logs show that controller receives the request and returns the correct render, but the browser sees the same content.

Possibilities:

- There's an authentication error: perhaps the login fails, and the user is not logged in.

But perhaps the form itself is doing something else.

A common cause for such issue is misconfiguration of the response format.

If the controller returns a redirect (302), in an Ajax request, the page may not be updated unless the client side executes JavaScript to handle that.

But given 'local: true', the form submission is via standard request, no Ajax.

Alternatively, perhaps the page includes Turbolinks, which can interfere and, which can cause the page not to reload fully.

In Rails, Turbolinks captures link clicks and form submissions (when the link/form was designed to be an 'unobtrusive' link), and loads pages via Ajax and replaces the body via JavaScript.

But perhaps there's a Turbolinks issue.

Moreover, the problem may be that the form is rendered on the page, but it's being submitted via standard request, and the response is not being properly handled by Turbolinks due to format.

Alternatively, is the issue caused by the 'session' cookie not being set? That is, after login, the response is a redirect to the dashboard, but the session cookie is not being set as expected, possibly due to SameSite policy or CSRF token.

But the logs say the controller receives request and returns the render (presumably a redirect). But the page itself shows the same content.

For instance, perhaps the issue is a redirect loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the login process is redirecting to a report page which is the same as the login page (non-protected), with different content, but perhaps the view shows no different content.

Moreover, the difference between 'get' request (like for login page) and 'post' request (after login) may not affect the content.

Further, if the site uses some JavaScript framework or CSS that causes content not to be updated, perhaps the page's DOM is not being replaced or has error.

Additionally, perhaps the issue is with the request's content-type (e.g., text/html vs
