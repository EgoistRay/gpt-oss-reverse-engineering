Why is this necessary?" maybe because they want to compute the derivative of F at some point; but we just computed derivative at any point. But maybe they want to differentiate F with respect to x, not y: Because F is function of a vector: F(x, y, u(x, y)). But they ask derivative of the function of x? Hmm.

Let's parse the original problem: "Let $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a smooth function, let $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ be an open set, $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be any interval. Consider $u \colon U \to V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function with $\| \nabla u \|_\infty < k < 1$ for some $k > 0$. Let $(x,y) \in U$, $p = (x,y,u(x,y) ) \in \mathbb{R}^3 = \{(x,y,z) \mid x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\}$. What is the derivative of the function $$F(x,y,u(x,y))\colon U \to \mathbb{R}^3$$?" Actually the derivative of that function at a point (x,y). The mapping F: \R^3 \to \R^3; we compose with the graph mapping (x,y) -> (x,y,u(x,y)). The derivative at point (x,y). We computed above. So answer is JF(p) [1,0,u_x]^T + JF(p)[0,1,u_y]^T? Wait JF is 3x3. So derivative is 3x2. Good.

But maybe they ask "What is the derivative of the function $F(x,y,u(x,y))\colon U \to \mathbb{R}^3$?" They might want "It is equal to DF(p) \circ (I + \nabla u(x,y))"? Actually derivative of mapping (x,y) -> (x,y,u(x,y)). That derivative matrix is [ [1,0], [0,1], [u_x, u_y] ], 3x2. Compose with DF(p) (3x3) yields 3x2 matrix.

Hence derivative of composite:

$$D[F(x,y,u(x,y))] = D F|_{(x,y,u(x,y))} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ u_x & u_y \end{pmatrix}$$

Alternatively, the derivative in direction h is (DF(p)) * (1,0,u_x) h1 + ... Wait we can present derivative as a matrix or as vector derivative formula.

So the answer: derivative is:

$$(DF\circ (x,y,u(x,y))) \, \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\\ u_x & u_y \end{pmatrix}$$

or component wise:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}F(x,y,u(x,y)) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}(x,y,u(x,y)) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}(x,y,u(x,y))\, u_x(x,y)$$

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial y}F(x,y,u(x,y)) = \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}(x,y,u(x,y)) + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}(x,y,u(x,y))\, u_y(x,y)$$

Now, the condition \|\nabla u\|_\infty < k < 1 ensures that the derivative of graph mapping is Lipschitz < 1? Wait: \nabla u bounded by k < 1 ensures the Jacobian matrix of the graph mapping has singular values maybe < sqrt(k^2+1)?? Actually we compute the derivative of the mapping (x, y) -> (x,y,u(x,y)). Its matrix is:

[[1,0], [0,1], [u_x, u_y]].

We want to show that this matrix has norm less than sqrt(1 + k^2)? Because gradient is bounded by k, each derivative of u is less than k. So the 3x2 matrix's operator norm? Suppose we compute the operator norm: sup_{||h||=1}||A h||. A is 3x2. Because u_x^2 + u_y^2 <= k^2. So each vector (h1,h2) maps to (h1, h2, u_x h1 + u_y h2). So norm
