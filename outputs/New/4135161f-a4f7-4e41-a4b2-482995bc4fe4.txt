New, about 0.23, at t=46 New 8. Nested.

Let's compute each:

- In 8 days, 2^8=256, new base in b=256/12≈21.3

S>=23 -> need 23 in b, needs 8 days.

- In 2 days, 2^2=4, new base=4/12≈0.33, S>=23 -> need 23 in b, needs 3 days (since 2^3=8>23). Actually we must consider b started at 0.33; after 3 days: new=0.33*8=2.66, S=8.68 insufficient; Wait we miscalc due to rounding.

Let's consider actual base flow after 2 days: S=35; T=374-35=339 -> 339/12=28.25 new swimming male.

But new swim male increases S further; but base doubling may outrun.

Again complexity.

Maybe need more formal? But due to time, perhaps best to compute algorithm: simulate using time steps: maintain base counts (b/w) as real numbers; at each day decide to swim or keep new (as needed). For each day, if we count to maintain base, we check if ejected revived dw >= needed to reach target; if not, we keep new and repeat same day.

Implement step algorithm:

At each day t, we know base counts, current day factor 2^t.

We compute T = N - S. We need new-ejected revive required Y = T/(k_s + k_c). For each param of T, we compute minimal n days to accumulate S+ k_?*n*cur_increase >=N and time needed.

We can compute days to accumulate new ejected using base doubling eventually.

For each day, we simulate as: let t_cur. We maintain two integer counters: base_swim, base_couple, cur_seconds_j.

We compute infinite? But we choose day increments until threshold.

Let S is discovered at end of day t.

Now we check if we can finish in 1 more day? If we attempt to keep new for 1 day, we will have new reviving: K_s*D. After that day, S_new = S + reviving + new*increased; if S_new>=N, done. If not, remain.

But still not guarantee.

Given complexity, perhaps I'll try to compute using brute force over days with rational numbers up to maybe 8 days with high precision double. I can simulate each day increment but in that simulation we need to compute number of new to keep daily, but we can decide to keep all new each day until S hits N.

Hence algorithm: For t from 1 until something: Compute a_n = b * 2^(t-1), updated from before. At start of day t, we compute S as sum of previous base values. Then we attempt each day to keep new. We'll compute S_new = S + K_s * (b * 2^(t-1)) + K_c * (w * 2^(t-1)). After this day, if S_new>=N, we're done; else set S = S_new, continue.

But this basically means we always keep all new every day, which might overshoot; but we might overshoot. But we can stop once we reach N. In this plan, we don't ever couple or swim anyone; we just keep all new and accumulate. But we may then not meet required ratio of males? Since all keepers are male, all new will be males. That would produce all male. But we might only need 20% male, but you may overshoot though not harmful. Since all new are male, we will always have male >= 90% as well.

Hence the fastest way might be to just keep all new for each day until N reached. Is that allowed? We didn't couple or swim anyone; but we kept them all; that may original solution not coupling leads to no revival events except when they appear by doubling. But if we keep all new at each day, they will be a part of population of that day. Then the next day's base increases by doubling again etc. So you never revive; you just accumulate. So you essentially stall any reshoots or cows.

This seems plausible simple, but might produce too many males (since all keepers male). That's okay? The requirement is male >=20%. All male satisfies.

Hence this approach might produce a minimal time solution because you never waste time coupling or swimming.

But if all male, good. So we just keep all new each day, and check when N reached.

Let's test this for example 3. We start t=1, already unpaired. After day1 keep all new: S=12 + 8
