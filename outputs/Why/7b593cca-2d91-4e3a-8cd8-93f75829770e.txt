Why should `https://`?" need to parse precisely: "1897 through SSDT associated with an incoming connection for Cryptography. The mail encrypts the resulting timestamp (and a random 128-bit big-end icon). The resulting ciphertext and random nonce are transmitted and is recorded as the fundamental version of a sequence of `sha256 + different each: [32]` variable `j` in LIPHS and AES-encrypt denote request/lookup code. The user has to ACK the packet, then from the external encryption packet the server type Facebook check the password != `Create Data Type Encrypted Files`. Note: the encryption model is assembly talking over message bodies." Yet the question: "Online encryption typically requires `https`.... So let us parse: 1. Provide cryptographic approach: Using `ssl` protocol for transmission; use TLS; use encryption on data in JSON; use encryption of the request body; but use lexical

Wait: The user conversation: "Can you do that please ... <some text> ..."

Wait need to parse from the given context. Maybe we have to respond: "Why should HTTPS be used? And about offline encryption." Hmm.

Original user: "why should https end treat? The user encryption to call encryption as unknown? Provide general explanation and best practice." The actual question: "The user must do the link between the message body encryption of https, and by requiring the transmission of the KMS encryption scheme of Crypto services? ..."

Maybe we just have to respond generically: Why `https`? For encryption, confidentiality, integrity, authenticity. Without `https` there is no TLS handshake; confidentiality may be achieved by encrypting the body, but integrity and authenticity require verification, like HMAC; if you implement encryption yourself you need to address key management, authenticity, forward secrecy, secure random, proper modes. Use SSL/TLS.

But the question: "why should https?" Well for usual. The problem: They attached custom encryption scheme for request bodies but still use HTTP? They may think that encryption of the body is enough but not. Need to use HTTPS. Use TLS that handles encryption, authentication via server certificates, and optional client certificates, also ensures integrity. Also helps with key exchange etc.

We propose to use TLS; maybe optional to also sign with HMAC; or use signature of everything, etc.

We also propose to use DigiByte: a wallet? Actually part of conversation: "webexical? Didn't want to see yubikey go offline... that's fine, we will do a fallback... small but important part - what is the 128-bit key or nonce? Should be random. Use random 96-bit/128-bit etc. For AES-128 needs 128-bit key, 4 or 12 bytes nonce. Use GCM or CBC. Use high-level library."

We might also refer to https to secure the channel; encryption if using https already. Or maybe he wants to use wss (websocket). So we need to discuss the significance.

Also possibility: The question: "to do the webserver for OTP or to handle offline? Yes we need to use HTTPS."

Thus final answer: Provide general guidelines: Use HTTPS for confidentiality; use TLS handshake; use <https://> ensures encryption of all traffic; no need to implement custom encryption; if customizing, need to handle key transport (public key infrastructure etc). Also need to handle forward secrecy. Provide steps for implementing encryption of request body; but better to use TLS; use encryption library; use standard protocols; use JWT for authentication; etc.

Also mention not to adopt your encryption; use proven cryptographic primitives; if using AES-256 + GCM, 128-bit key, 12-byte IV. Use random seeds; use random number generator; use HMAC for authentication to ensure integrity; use TLS to ensure authenticity of server.

Thus propose answer accordingly.

But we need to produce final ChatGPT answer: summarizing that "HTTPS is essential because it ensures confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, protects DNS, mitigates certificate theft etc. Without HTTPS, you must implement your own encryption scheme, which is error-prone. Use TLS. Use the best practice: use HSTS to enforce https; easiest to use Let's Encrypt; use proper rest restful design; if you use a JSON body encryption is not enough because the request headers (URL, query parameters, etc.) might be exposed. Also the TLS handshake ensures forward secrecy and protects keys. Use client certificate, but intangible. Use SS... etc.

Also to answer their query: bridging "why should https?" Provide reason: encryption of HTTP data ensures confidentiality, integrity; also encryption of entire network path; ensures data can't be sniffed or tampered; and prevents MITM. The custom encryption of only request body is insufficient because attacker can sniff TLS handshake details or query params; and you must also ensure signatures.

Hence we provide step-by-step approach: Use TLS and
