What is the role of the $C^*$-algebra $\tilde{A}$ and its unitization $\tilde{A}_1$ in the proof? How does the map $\phi: \tilde{A} \to C(\T,\R)^+$ come into play, and what does it mean for $\phi(x)$ to not vanish on a set of positive measure?

Answer:

The $C^*$-algebra $\tilde{A}$ is a particular $C^*$-algebra constructed from $A$ as described in Proposition 2.3. The unitization $\tilde{A}_1$ is then the unitization of this algebra. The map $\phi: \tilde{A} \to C(\T,\R)^+$ is a homomorphism that essentially encodes the "tracial state" structure of $\tilde{A}$, where $C(\T,\R)^+$ consists of positive functions on the unit circle.

For $\phi(x)$ to not vanish on a set of positive measure means that the function $\phi(x): \T \to [0,\infty)$ is positive on a subset of the circle $\T$ that has positive Lebesgue measure. In other words, it's not the case that $\phi(x)(t) = 0$ for almost every $t \in \T$.

Exercise 8: Understanding the role of Lemma 3.1

Explain the significance of Lemma 3.1: Let $A$ be a simple $C^*$-algebra with property (SP), and $p,q \in \tilde{A}_1$ be orthogonal, full projections. Then there exist orthogonal partial isometries $v,w \in \tilde{A}_1$ such that $v^*v = w^*w = p$, $vv^* = ww^* = q$, and the partial isometries $v,w, v^*, w^*$ lie in the closed subalgebra generated by $p,q$.

Answer:

Lemma 3.1 essentially says that given two orthogonal, full projections $p$ and $q$ in $\tilde{A}_1$, we can find partial isometries $v$ and $w$ such that $v$ and $w$ have the same initial projection $p$ and the same final projection $q$, and moreover $v^*$ and $w^*$ also have the same initial projection $q$ and the same final projection $p$. This lemma is useful because it allows us to construct a certain kind of partial isometry that "moves" $p$ to $q$ while also ensuring that the algebra generated by this isometry has the property that $pq=qp=0$.

The fact that $v,w, v^*, w^*$ lie in the closed subalgebra generated by $p,q$ is also important, especially in situations where we want to restrict to a subalgebra of $\tilde{A}_1$.

Exercise 9: Analyzing the argument after Lemma 3.1

In the proof of the proposition, it says "Then there exists a unitary $u \in \tilde{A}$ such that $u^*pu=q$ and $u^*qu=p$." Explain why this is true.

Answer:

This statement relies on the fact that $p$ and $q$ are full projections, and the algebra is simple, so the only ideal in $\tilde{A}$ is $\{0\}$ or $\tilde{A}$ itself. In this setting, any two non-zero projections are equivalent if they are Murray-von Neumann equivalent in the algebra. Since $p$ and $q$ are orthogonal, full projections, they are also equivalent. So, there exists a partial isometry $w \in \tilde{A}$ with $w^*w = p$ and $ww^* = q$. Then we can "unitarize" $w$ by taking $u$ to be a unitary in $\tilde{A}$ that extends $w$ in the sense that it implements $p$ to $q$. The precise construction depends on the algebra structure and the fact that $\tilde{A}$ is simple with property (SP). The unitary $u$ will have the property $u^*p u = q$ and $u^*q u = p$ since $p$ and $q$ are orthogonal.
