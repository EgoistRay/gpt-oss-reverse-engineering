A, 2} = 5 \), and all higher \( d_{A, k} \) vanish.

**Alice**: Great, so our calculation suggests that \( A \) is indeed a \( (2, 2, 5) \)-\( \mathbb{Z}/2 \)-cell complex. This gives us a concrete example of such a complex with two 1-cells, two 3-cells, and five 4-cells. 

**Bob**: Moreover, we can analyze the cohomology groups \( \widehat{H}^k(A; \mathbb{F}_2) \). For \( k = 0, 1 \), these groups are trivial as \( A \) is non-contractible but has no cells of lower degree. There's a nontrivial cohomology class \( \omega \in \widehat{H}^2(A; \mathbb{F}_2) \) which supports a degree-two cohomology class.

**Alice**: And in higher degrees, for \( 2 < k \leq N+2 \), the cohomology groups \( \widehat{H}^k(A; \mathbb{F}_2) \cong \mathbb{F}_2^{d_{A, k-1}+d_{A, k-2}} \). For our specific cell counts, the dimensions would be:

- \( \widehat{H}^3(A; \mathbb{F}_2) \cong \mathbb{F}_2^{d_{A, 2} + d_{A, 1}} = \mathbb{F}_2^{5 + 2} = \mathbb{F}_2^7 \),
- \( \widehat{H}^4(A; \mathbb{F}_2) \cong \mathbb{F}_2^{d_{A, 3} + d_{A, 2}} = \mathbb{F}_2^{2 + 5} = \mathbb{F}_2^7 \),
- and so on.

**Bob**: This analysis showcases how the \( \mathbb{Z}/2 \) involution influences the cellular structure and cohomological properties of \( A \). The presence of the involution imposes symmetric constraints, leading to particular patterns in the cell counts and cohomology.

**Alice**: Indeed, and this structure would be crucial in understanding the homotopy type of spaces with \( \mathbb{Z}/2 \) actions and their implications in K-theory and beyond.

**Bob**: Absolutely. The study of such cell complexes provides valuable insights into equivariant topology, especially when considering spectra associated with real or complex K-theory, which are deeply connected to such equivariant phenomena.Alice: Hey Bob, I wanted to discuss a problem involving optimal consumption under transaction costs. Have you thought about how to find the optimal consumption strategy in such a setting?

Bob: Yeah, Alice. The problem is really challenging because transaction costs make the dynamics of portfolios trickier to analyze. I think we should look at a value function that represents the maximum expected utility under these constraints.

Alice: Agreed. Suppose we denote the value function by \( \mathbf{V}(x, y) \), with \( x \) being the cash amount and \( y \) the risky asset amount. We need to find \( \mathbf{V} \) that satisfies certain boundary conditions, and the goal is to identify an optimal strategy for consumption and trading.

Bob: Right. The key is to look for a function \( \mathbf{V} \) that satisfies the dynamic programming principle, typically expressed through a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. For the problem at hand with transaction costs, the HJB equation would involve a certain operator \( \mathbf{L}_0 \). For smooth \( \mathbf{V} \), we should have:
\[ \max\left\{ \mathbf{L}_0 \mathbf{V}, \frac{\partial \mathbf{V}}{\partial c} - c \right\} = 0. \]
Here, \( c \) is the consumption rate.

Alice: Exactly. The term \( \mathbf{L}_0 \mathbf{V} \) reflects the infinitesimal change in \( \mathbf{V} \) due to the dynamics of the portfolio, while \( \frac{\partial \mathbf{V}}{\partial c} - c \) balances consumption against the marginal utility.

Bob: So, to find the optimal strategy, we need to look for a function \( \mathbf{V} \) and a strategy \( \varphi(t) \) such that the wealth process \( X_t^\varphi \) and
