What if the input file contains something like:

```
3
5 4
5 6 2
4
6 5
1 1 2 2
3
...
```

Then it's fine. Our code will parse each test.

What if the file ends with some whitespace lines? We skip them. Good.

Edge-case: If n=0? But constraints say n>=1, but just in case, if n=0, we can handle by skip reading array? But we skip reading any array? We should handle but constraints n>=1.

So all fine.

Thus the answer is correct.

But let's test with random input:

```
1
5 10
5 5 5 5 5
```

All 5's. For each index: left count: 0,1,2,3,4; right count: 4,3,2,1,0. sum=5,5,... all 5. So output 5. That seems correct.

What about array with decreasing values like [4,3,2,1]? For x4 at index 0: left count=0, right count: elements <=4 are all 3,2,1 =>3 => sum=3. For x3 (index1): left: 4>3? No =>0; right: 2,1 =>2 => sum=2. For x2 (idx2): left: 4>2? No; 3>2? No =>0; right: 1 =>1 => sum=1. For x1: left: 4>1? no;3>1? no; etc =>0; right: none =>0, sum=0. So output [3,2,1,0].

Let's test:

```
input_data = "1\n4 10\n4 3 2 1\n"
print(run_io_fun(input_data, solve))
```

It should output "3 2 1 0".

Let's test. (We can't actually run code here, but logically it's correct).

Thus the program works.

Now, check for performance: For each test, we allocate freq array of size up to 10001, and freq_buckets dictionary of size up to n keys. Then we run loops: first loop over values (max_value+1 ~10k). For each v, we iterate over freq_buckets[v], but the total number of iterations across all v is n. So the total time is O(20000 + n). Then we iterate over array again (n). So overall O(n + value_range). So for n=1e5, fine.

Memory usage: freq_buckets stores each index once, so about n ints. For n=1e5, that is ~800KB, fine. freq array is 10k ints ~ 80KB, fine.

For t=10, total memory overhead is similar. We don't keep all tests at once.

Thus memory is fine.

Edge-case: For large n and values, reading input with sys.stdin.read() is fine. The input can be up to maybe about 2 million tokens, each token maybe up to 6 digits or so, so about 12MB string, ok.

Thus performance is fine.

Thus the solution is correct.

But let's double-check the problem statement: "For each number xi, find the maximum number that can be obtained by summing the total number of elements which were greater than it to the total number of elements less than or equal to it. This will be repeated for all the elements of the array." Actually this is exactly what we computed.

So final answer is just the sum for each element.

Thus code is correct.

But I want to re-read the statement: "maximum number that can be obtained by summing the total number of elements which were greater than it to the total number of elements less than or equal to it." Wait, "maximum number that can be obtained" - maximum of what? But we just sum left greater count + right less/equal count. That is what the examples confirm.

Thus we are good.

Let's test a few more random cases:

Case 1: t=1, n=2, k something, array [a,b]. Suppose a=5,b=3. For a: left greater 0, right less/equal 1 (b=3 <=5) => 1. For b: left greater 1 (a=5>3), right less/equal 0 =>1. So output 1 1.

Case 2: array [a,b] both equal, say [3,3]. For a: left greater 0, right <=? b <=3 => true =>1 =>1. For b: left> 3>3? false =>0, right <=?
