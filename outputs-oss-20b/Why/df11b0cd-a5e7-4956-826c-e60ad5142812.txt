Why? Because we need to check each pair; If there is some pair where x is not in set or y is not in set, we return false. Because we want all pairs to have both endpoints in set.

Edge: Suppose we have pair (0,1) and (2,3); set {0,1,2,3} -> both endpoints of each pair are in the set. Good.

Suppose set {0,1,1,2} -> pair (0,1) ok; pair (2,3) fails because 3 not in set.

Suppose set {0,1,2,3} -> all pair endpoints exist.

Hence algorithm works.

Complexities:

- n <= 2 * 10^5, each set of size k <= 5, pairs <= 4. So each check O(k + m) constant, times number of permutations 120, times number of positions up to 2e5: 1.2e7, fine.

Now we need to implement in PHP 8.0.

Implementation details:

- We'll parse input using fgets and explode; but need to handle up to 2e5 numbers; so reading entire line and splitting might be memory heavy but still fine (2e5 ints). Use reading loops.

- Since k <= 5, we can store a_i in array of ints.

- We'll generate permutations using next_permutation algorithm or by using recursion. In PHP we can use function to produce permutations of indices 0..k-1 using recursion or built-in `array_multisort`? We'll manually generate.

But we need to generate permutations for each test case; k <=5, so at most 120; we can produce all permutations using built-in `array_multisort` or `combinations`.

Implement:

$indices = range(0, $k-1);
// generate perms using function `permutations($array)` that returns array of arrays.

Implement recursion:

function permute($arr, $l, $r, &$result, $k)
{
  if ($l == $r) {
     $result[] = $arr;
  } else {
     for ($i = $l; $i <= $r; $i++) {
        $tmp = $arr[$l];
        $arr[$l] = $arr[$i];
        $arr[$i] = $tmp;
        permute($arr, $l+1, $r, $result);
        // backtrack
        $tmp = $arr[$l];
        $arr[$l] = $arr[$i];
        $arr[$i] = $tmp;
     }
  }
}

Call permute(range(0,k-1), 0, k-1, $perms, $k);

But we may generate duplicates (none). Works.

Now algorithm details:

Input reading:

$firstLine = trim(fgets(STDIN));
list($n, $k, $m) = array_map('intval', explode(' ', $firstLine));

Second line: list of a_i. Since k small, we can parse:

$aiLine = trim(fgets(STDIN));
$a = array_map('intval', explode(' ', $aiLine));
// if less than k numbers due to newlines? We'll read until we have k numbers; but given input lines may contain trailing spaces; but we can rely on reading exactly one line.

Third line: pairs: m numbers -> 2m ints

We may need to read multiple lines if 2*m may exceed typical line length; but we can just loop to read until we have 2*m numbers. Implementation: $pairTokens = []; while (count($pairTokens) < 2*$m){ $line = trim(fgets(STDIN)); if ($line==='') continue; $tokens = array_map('intval', preg_split('/\s+/', $line)); $pairTokens = array_merge($pairTokens, $tokens); }

After reading, build array of pairs: $pairs = []; for i 0..m-1: $u = $pairTokens[2*i] - 1; $v = $pairTokens[2*i+1] - 1; $pairs[] = [$u, $v];

Now algorithm loops:

$indices = range(0, $k-1);
$perms = [];
permute($indices, 0, $k-1, $perms);

But generating all perms as arrays will produce many memory but fine.

For each permutation $ord in $perms:

We need to iterate positions.

$last = array_fill(0, $k, -1);
$posInSeq = array_fill(0, $k, $n); // sentinel n for none

For ($start = 0; $start < $n; $start++) {
    $posInSeq[$
