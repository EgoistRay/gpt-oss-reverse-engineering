The problem is a well-established algorithmic challenge, known as the "3x+1" problem, or Collatz conjecture. The task asks us to determine whether all integers up to a given number \( N \) (where \( N \) can go up to \( 1000 \)) will converge to 1 following a specific iterative procedure.

The procedure is as follows:
1. Take an integer \( A \).
2. If \( A \leq 1 \), output 1.
3. If \( A \) is even, divide it by 2.
4. If \( A \) is odd, transform it to \( 3A + 1 \).
5. Repeat until the process reaches 1.

The solution approach involves the following steps:
- For all integers from 1 to \( N \), we apply the iterative procedure and track their progress. If any integer does not reach 1 within some reasonable computational constraints (which is a theoretical guarantee based on known properties of the 3x+1 conjecture), we output "NO".
- If all integers succeed in reaching 1, we output "YES".

The conjecture is widely believed to hold for all integers, and there's no known counterexample. Given computational constraints, we can simulate these steps for the specified range, and due to the conjecture's nature and the constraints on \( N \), this approach will determine the correctness for each test case.

The given solution approach involves the following:
The problem statement... (cut)
We need to solve problem: given integer N (1 <= N <= 1000), determine if all integers A from 1..N will converge to 1 under the Collatz sequence. Output "YES" if all converge, "NO" otherwise. The problem is? Might be from e-olymp or something.

We need to produce a solution in Rust 1.56.

We need to read multiple test cases? Wait statement: "Given an integer N, determine whether all integers A from 1 to N inclusive...". Might only be a single input. But maybe multiple test cases until EOF. We'll need to parse.

We can implement simulation for each A up to N: apply collatz until we hit 1. Since N <= 1000, simulation is fine. For each A we may need to iterate potentially many times. Known maximum number of steps for numbers < 1000 is maybe 500 steps? Actually Collatz numbers can grow large. For N up to 1000, numbers can go up to maybe 10^4? Let's just simulate with u64 to avoid overflow. For odd numbers: 3*A+1 may overflow u64 for huge A. But starting from A <=1000 and we keep applying until we reach 1. The maximum value may exceed 2^64? Unlikely. Let's approximate: worst-case for small numbers, the sequence grows but not huge. For 1000, the max value encountered is about 2,500? Actually for 27 it's 9232. For 1000, might exceed 10^6? but still small.

So we can use u64. We'll simulate: while a > 1: if a % 2 ==0 -> a/=2 else a=3*a+1. Count steps; maybe break after some large steps to avoid infinite; but we trust the conjecture. So we just simulate until 1.

If any number does not converge (unlikely within steps), we output "NO". But we might set an iteration limit say 10_000. But the problem expects we output "YES" for all numbers. So we just compute; if any fails within limit, output NO.

Alternatively, we could use property that the conjecture known to hold for all numbers up to 10^20. So for <=1000 it's definitely true. So always output YES. But we cannot rely on that maybe they expect simulation.

Better: simulate.

Input format: Might be single integer N. Example? Not provided. We assume one integer. But many e-olymp tasks ask multiple test cases until EOF. But we can read all ints from stdin and process each? We'll produce output for each input N on separate line.

But statement: "Given an integer N, determine whether all integers A from 1 to N inclusive will converge to 1" So there is likely only one test case.

Let's design solution: read single N from stdin.

Compute bool all_converge=true; For a from 1 to N inclusive: cur = a as u64; while cur > 1 { if cur %2==0 { cur /=2; } else{cur = 3*cur+1; } } If cur==1 then continue else break? But loop ends at 1.

Thus always true. So output YES. But to match problem we implement simulation.

Let's
