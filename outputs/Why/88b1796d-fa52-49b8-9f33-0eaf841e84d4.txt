Why Not:** The main reason not to use `==` with a `DateTime` variable is that it would compare the values of the two `DateTime` objects instead of checking if they reference the same `DateTime` object. To compare the values of two `DateTime` objects, you should use the `.Equals()` method or the `==` operator which is overloaded for `DateTime` to perform value comparison. However, if you only want to check whether the reference has changed, you can use the `!=` operator.

Here is a corrected version of the text, with improved grammar and consistency in tense:

```
The code is creating a new `DateTime` object with the current system date and time. It also creates a `DateTime` variable from the `DateTime` objects created by the `CreateDateTime` method. The `!=` operator is checking equality, which is not the correct approach. 
```

```vb
Dim mydate As New DateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12, 0, 0)
Dim mydate1 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12)
Dim mydate2 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 9)
Debug.Print(mydate = mydate1) ' False
Debug.Print(mydate = mydate1) ' False - 12

mydate < mydate2 ' No output

The line "Debug.Print(mydate = mydate1) ' False" should be "Debug.Print(mydate = mydate1) ' True".

- We should use the `DateTime.TryParseExact` method to create the DateTime object.
- `mydate` needs to

The code is creating a new DateTime object with the current system date and time. It also creates DateTime variables from the DateTime objects created by the `CreateDateTime` method. The use of the `!=` operator should be replaced with the proper approach for comparing DateTime values. 

Here is a corrected version of the code and the steps needed to compare DateTime objects correctly:

```vb
' Create DateTime instances
Dim mydate As New DateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12, 0, 0)
Dim mydate1 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12)
Dim mydate2 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 9)

' Output whether mydate and my

Sure! Here is a revised version of your text, including a corrected code snippet for better comparison of `DateTime` values in VB.NET:

**Title: Correcting DateTime Comparisons in Visual Basic .NET**

In the provided code, a new `DateTime` object is created using the system's current date and time. The code also attempts to create `DateTime` objects from custom input parameters using a `CreateDateTime` function. The code uses incorrect comparison operators in determining equality and time comparison.

Below is the corrected code and explanation:
```vb
' Definitions and instantiation of DateTime objects
Dim mydate As New DateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12, 0, 0)  ' Static date and time
' Assuming 'CreateDateTime' creates DateTime objects correctly
Dim mydate1 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 12)
Dim mydate2 As DateTime = CreateDateTime(2007, 7, 14, 9)

' Comparison outputs
Debug.Print(mydate = mydate1) ' Expected "True" if both contain the same date & time
Debug.Print(mydate = mydate2) ' Expected "False" as times differ

' Comparison to check if one datetime is earlier than another
If mydate < mydate2 Then
    Debug.Print("mydate precedes mydate2.")
Else
    Debug.Print("mydate does not precede mydate2.")
End If
```

### Key Points:
- **Equal comparison** is performed with `=` which is overloaded for the `DateTime` structure to verify value equality.
- **Time comparison** requires operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` directly to assess whether one `DateTime` instance occurs before or after another.
