In Java, this would be represented using Maps and Lists.

The code would read from a JSON file, parse it into a Java Map or custom data class, then serialize it into a binary format, write it back to a file, read it again, and deserialize to a Map or custom object, then reconstruct to JSON for comparison.

Now, per instructions, I need to focus on the core logic, and can be "light on mockups / placeholders / boilerplate," meaning I can focus on the essential code.

Given that, I can write a Java class that does the following:

- Reads a JSON string into a Java Map or custom class.

- Uses a serialization library to convert the Java object to bytes (say using Java's built-in serialization, or a library).

- Writes the bytes to a file.

- Reads the bytes from the file.

- Deserializes the bytes back into a Java object.

- Serializes the object back to JSON.

- Compares the original JSON and the reconstructed JSON.

I can use Java's built-in serialization, but it's generally not recommended for cross-platform usage, but for this test code, it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we can use libraries like Jackson for JSON handling, and for serialization, we can use Java's ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream.

Therefore, in Java:

- Use Jackson's ObjectMapper to parse JSON to Map<String, Object>.

- Use Java's ObjectOutputStream to write the Map to a file as serialized bytes.

- Use ObjectInputStream to read from file and reconstruct the Map.

- Use Jackson again to serialize the Map back to JSON.

- Compare the original JSON and reconstructed JSON.

Now, let's proceed to code this.

Given that, the code would involve:

- Importing necessary libraries: Jackson's ObjectMapper, Java IO classes.

- Reading a JSON string.

- Writing and reading serialized data.

- Comparing two JSON strings.

Now, per instruction, be minimal on boilerplate, focusing on the core logic.

So, in the code, we need to:

1. Create a JSON string.

2. Use Jackson's ObjectMapper to parse it into a Map.

3. Use ObjectOutputStream to write the Map to a file.

4. Use ObjectInputStream to read the Map back.

5. Use Jackson to convert the Map back to JSON string.

6. Compare both JSON strings.

Also, as per instruction, output a single code file and nothing else.

Now, proceed to write this Java code file.

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class JsonSerializationTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Original JSON string
        String originalJson = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"address\":\"123 Main St, New York\",\"age\":28,\"children\":{\"child1\":\"Alice\",\"child2\":\"Bob\"}}";

        // Parse JSON into a Java Map
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Map<String, Object> originalMap = mapper.readValue(originalJson, new TypeReference<Map<String, Object>>(){});

        // Serialize the Map to a byte array
        ByteArrayOutputStream byteOut = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(byteOut);
        out.writeObject(originalMap);
        out.close();
        byte[] serializedData = byteOut.toByteArray();

        // Deserialize the byte array back into a Map
        ByteArrayInputStream byteIn = new ByteArrayInputStream(serializedData);
        ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(byteIn);
        Map<String, Object> deserializedMap = (Map<String, Object>) in.readObject();
        in.close();

        // Convert deserialized Map back to JSON string
        String reconstructedJson = mapper.writeValueAsString(deserializedMap);

        // Output original and reconstructed JSON
        System.out.println("Original JSON:   " + originalJson);
        System.out.println("Reconstructed JSON: " + reconstructedJson);

        // Verify that the original and reconstructed JSON strings are equal
        if (objectsEqual(originalMap, deserializedMap)) {
            System.out.println("Success: The original and reconstructed JSON structures are equivalent.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Failure: The original and reconstructed JSON structures differ.");
        }
    }

    // Helper method to compare two objects deeply
    private static boolean objectsEqual(Object o1, Object o2) {
        if (o1 == o2) return true;
        if (o1 == null || o2 == null) return false;
        if (o1 instanceof Map && o2 instanceof Map) {
            Map<?, ?>
