This method `addNew` returns a `String`. This is typical of JSF action methods that return a navigation outcome.

- It calls `create()` on the `dao`. This likely creates a new entity record in the database.
- It then adds a new message to the `FacesContext` saying "Successfully added". The message is a `FacesMessage` with a severity of `INFO`. The first argument "Successfully added" might be the summary, and the second argument "" is the detail. 
  - The `FacesUtils.addMessage(...)` method seems to take a `FacesMessage` and add it to the context. It also uses the string "Message" which might be a client ID of a component that should display the message.
- Then it sets `this.edit` to a new instance of `T`. This likely resets the form to be ready for another new entry.
- It sets `this.action` to "addNew", which might be used for logging or display purposes.
- Then it returns an empty string. In JSF, returning an empty string means to stay on the same page.

So this method handles creating a new entity and then resets the form.

```java
   public String delete() {
      dao.delete(this.edit);
      FacesUtils.addMessage(new FacesMessage(FacesMessage.SEVERITY_INFO, "Successfully deleted", ""));
      
      this.setAction("delete");
      return "";
   }
```
The `delete` method also returns a `String`. 

- It calls `delete(this.edit)` on the DAO. This would delete the current entity from the database.
- It adds a message saying "Successfully deleted".
- It sets the action to "delete".
- It returns an empty string.

This method handles deleting the current entity.

```java
   public void edit(T entity) {
      try {
         this.setAction("edit");
         this.edit = dao.findById(entity.getId());
      } catch (RuntimeException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
```
The `edit` method returns void and takes a `T entity`. This might be called when a user selects an entity to edit.

- It sets the action to "edit".
- It calls `dao.findById(entity.getId())` and sets this to `this.edit`. This means it retrieves the entity from the database by its ID and sets it as the entity to be edited.
- It's wrapped in a try-catch that catches `RuntimeException` and prints the stack trace.

This method prepares the form for editing an existing entity.

```java
   public void editById() {
      try {         
         this.setAction("edit");
         this.edit = dao.findById(id);
      } catch (RuntimeException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
   }
```
This `editById` method is similar to `edit`, but it uses the `id` field rather than an entity passed in.

- It sets the action to "edit".
- It calls `dao.findById(id)` and sets this to `this.edit`. This means it retrieves the entity with the given ID and sets it as the entity to be edited.
- It's also wrapped in a try-catch for `RuntimeException`.

```java
   public String init() {
      if (action == null || action.equals("") ) action = "addNew";
      
      //TODO : load data
      return "";
   }
```
The `init` method returns a `String`. This might be called when the page or component initializes.

- It checks if `action` is null or empty. If it is, it sets `action` to "addNew". This ensures that there is a default action.
- There's a comment `//TODO : load data`. This might mean that in a more complete implementation, this method would load data into the `list`.
- It returns an empty string, which means stay on the same page.

Now the remaining methods are getters and setters for `edit`, `list`, `action`, and `id`.

```java
   public T getEdit() {
      return edit;
   }

   public void setEdit(T edit) {
      this.edit = edit;
   }

   public List<T> getList() {
      return list;
   }

   public void setList(List<T> list) {
      this.list = list;
   }

   public String getAction() {
      return action;
   }

   public void setAction(String action) {
      this.action = action;
   }

   public Integer getId() {
      return id;
   }

   public void setId(Integer id) {
      this.id = id;
   }
}
```

Putting it all together, this `CRUDPage` class seems to be a JSF backing bean that manages CRUD operations for an entity of type `T`. It interacts with a `GenericDAO<T>` to
