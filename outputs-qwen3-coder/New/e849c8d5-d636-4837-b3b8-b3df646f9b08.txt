New: How to install WPS54G Rev. 1 & 2 without the CD
Dec 3 2007, 12:58 AM
Based upon the following method, using the latest firmware and the latest WMP54G hardware:
http://www.linksysinfo.org/modules...wtopic&t=25779
I no longer see any blue light (I have Universal Plug and Play turned off), and I can select a network on the desktop.
Although one never sees how to "exit" the application, the WPS button succeeds. Wireless communication works normally.
However, and this is the major problem, I cannot get the broadcom to work in the laptop at all. The WMP54G works in a desktop as I just described, but the laptop uses an AIRONET classic card whose driver is like 8 years old. The WMP54Gon the other hand is that last card with broadcom drivers and a 2.4 dBi antenna.
When I install the broadcom into the laptop, try to install it using the procedure above there IS no WPS button. The broadcom tries to verify itself with the WRT54G and fails: the access point tells me on its interface that no IP address was assigned. When I try to assign an IP with statics, I get no communication.
Do you have any ideas about how to get any of this working??
QUESTION: does the upcoming version 3 of the WRT54G hardware work with all this?

Answer: Yes but no...
The good news is it will work even better than the current versions.
The bad is news is not everything will be available at first. At launch only 1 Windows driver will be available to download for free. It will be found withing the normal support area like the others. More OS's versions will be added soon.

1) Is there a plan to support configuration via the GUI Administration interface, like older models, instead of / in addition to the Windows configuration utility?
2) Will Linux be explicitly "one of the OS versions [that] will be added soon"? If not, are you declining to discuss it for now because it is a) not planned or b) still under development?

Further clue: the laptop WMP54G RT works fine with an old WRT54G V.1.
However, the WMP54G is an RTM, and the new WRT54G is apparently not backwards compatible with RTs. This is the firmware error message:
The firmware inside the WMP54G is too old for the new WRT54GS. To upgrade your firmware please... insert cdrom into drive.
Is there any way for me to upgrade the card's firmware directly or to disable the automatic firmware upgrade query?

1. No plans for GUI interface at this time but is noted as a request.
2. WRT54G v3.0 will be fully supported in Linux.
Also all encryption methods not previous available on all cards will be available across all OSs

The following article explains how to install the latest RTM firmware (dated 10/25/2007) into any WMP54G RTM card to make it compatible with the
