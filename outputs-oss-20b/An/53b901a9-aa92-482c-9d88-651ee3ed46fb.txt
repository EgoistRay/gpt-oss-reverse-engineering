An alternative, more detailed treatment that includes the remaining electron \(\mu\) yields a factor \(\Gamma = \sqrt{2}\). We adopt this value to capture the true mean–field torque magnitude.

Thus the equation of motion for the collective angular momentum \(\vec{R}\) becomes:
\[
\boxed{
\frac{d \vec{R}}{dt}
= - \frac{2 \alpha}{\mathcal{H}'} \frac{c^{2}}{r_{K}} \,
\Gamma \, \frac{\hat{N}}{N}
\left( 1 - \frac{3J_{2}}{2}\,\frac{R_{*}^{2}}{r_{K}^{2}} \right)
\, \sqrt{ p \, \cos\!\bigl( p t \bigr) }.
}
\tag{1}
\]
The Hill radius \(r_{K}\) and the planet’s orbital period \(p =2\pi/T_{\!K}\) are determined by the planet’s mass and semi–major axis. The term in brackets accounts for the deleterious effect of planetary oblateness on the ionization rate.

The orientation of the torque vector is critical: it lies in the plane perpendicular to the orbital angular momentum \(\hat{N}\), aligning with the spin axis of the residual white dwarf (the "nuclear spin constraint"). Matter that remains ionized will be driven along toroidal trajectories around the planet.

#### 1.2. Mass Loss Rate in the Presence of Oblateness

The mass of ionized gas within the Roche–lobe volume can be expressed in terms of the corresponding fraction \(\mathcal{M}\) of the total atmospheric mass \(M_{\!A}\). The ionization fraction encodes the total volume intersected by the magnetic flux tubes threading the exoplanet. Since the mass loss rate is proportional to the rate of change of \(\mathcal{M}\), we find:
\[
\boxed{
\frac{d M}{dt}
= \frac{ M_{\!A}^{2} P \mu_{\!B} }{ \mathcal{H}' } \,
\frac{ 2 \alpha }{ r_{K} } 
\, \Gamma \,\frac{ \sqrt{ p \, \cos \!\bigl( p t \bigr) } }{ N }.
}
\tag{2}
\]
This expression explicitly reflects the dependence on the magnetic field strength \(B_{\!S}\) via the ratio \(P \mu_{\!B}/\mathcal{H}'\). It underscores the critical role of a strong stellar magnetosphere: higher \(B_{\!S}\) suppresses \(\mathcal{H}'\), steepening the potential barrier, and thereby reduces ionization unless the plasma temperature rises correspondingly.

Equations (1)–(2) provide the governing dynamics of the atmospheric gas under the combined effects of Roche geometry, stellar magnetic confinement, tidal forces, and planetary oblateness.

### 2. Analytical Scaling and Parameter Space Exploration

#### 2.1. Scaling Relations
The equations (1)–(2) admit a family of similarity transformations preserving the overall structure of the solution. Defining dimensionless parameters, we note the following scalings:

| Quantity | Transformation | Effect on the Solution |
|---|---|---|
| Radius of planet \(R_{*}\) | \(R_{*} \to k R_{*}\) | Alters Hill radius \(r_{K} \propto k^{4/3}\), period \(p \propto k^{-3/2}\) |
| Planetesimal mass \(M_{*}\) | \(M_{*} \to \lambda M_{*}\) | Alters Roche‐lobe mass \(M_{\!A} \propto \lambda^{1/5}\) |
| White dwarf mass \(M_{\!D}\) | \(M_{\!D} \to \eta M_{\!D}\) | Modifies tidal acceleration \(\propto \eta^{5/12}\), Hill radius \(\propto \eta^{1/3}\) |
| Magnetic field amplitude \(\gamma\) | \(\gamma \to \gamma + \epsilon\) | Changes \(\alpha = 1 - \gamma\), impacts ionization via \(\mathcal{H}' \propto (1-\gamma)^{9/5}\) |
| Stellar surface secular mass loss \(B_{*}\) | \(B_{*} \to B_{*} + \Delta B\) | Modulates \(M_{\!A}\) via \(\phi_{K}\), influencing quantity \(\hat{N}\) |

These scalings imply
