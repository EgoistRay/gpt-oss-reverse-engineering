What is the probability that the first of the $k$ numbers is odd?" Actually maybe the first of the k numbers that are odd? Wait: "The first of the k numbers is odd".

We can guess: There may be a scenario: A random integer is drawn and repeated until we obtain a number with exactly k factors. But I'm not sure.

Let's parse the original phrase: "The first of the $k$ numbers" could also refer to "the first of the $k$ digits that are 0 or 1"? Actually "numbers" maybe refers to something else: maybe it's the "first of the k numbers is odd"? That would be the probability that a randomly chosen integer among the first k digits? Not.

Let's step back: Suppose we want to compute the probability that a random integer has exactly k distinct prime factors. That probability tends to zero as k grows.

But "the first of the $k$ numbers" is ambiguous.

Let's consider that maybe the problem is:

"Suppose we choose k numbers uniformly at random from the set of positive integers less than or equal to n." Then the probability that the first chosen number is odd is simply the probability that a uniform random integer in [1,n] is odd. That probability is floor(n/2)/n ~ 1/2 if n is even or (n+1)/(2n) if n is odd. But as n grows, this probability tends to 1/2. But that is trivial. So not.

Alternatively: Suppose we have a random integer that we factor into prime factors. Among the k prime factors in the factorization, what is the probability that the first one (like the smallest or first in some ordering) is odd? That would be something like 1 - 1/2^? Actually maybe the primes 2,3,5,... So the smallest prime factor is 2 with high probability? Actually the smallest prime factor of a random integer is 2 with probability ~1/2, 3 with some probability, etc. But for the first of all prime factors in the factorization (ordered by size), the probability that it's odd is basically 1 - probability it equals 2. So it's about 1/2? Actually the probability that the smallest prime factor is >2 is roughly 1/2, because if integer is odd, smallest prime factor is at least 3. So probability that smallest prime factor is odd = probability integer is odd? Actually if the integer is even, smallest prime factor is 2, else if odd, smallest prime factor is some odd prime. So probability smallest prime factor is odd equals probability integer is odd = 1/2. So trivial again.

But the phrase "the first of the $k$ numbers" might refer to the "first of the k numbers in some representation"? Not.

Alternatively maybe we consider "k-digit number" with digits chosen uniformly random from {0,...,9} with some restrictions (leading digit may not be zero). The probability that the first digit (the leftmost one) is odd? That would be something like 5/9? Actually digits 1-9 inclusive, half odd half even except 0. For first digit cannot be 0, so digits set {1,...,9}. Out of these, odd digits are 1,3,5,7,9 => 5 odd digits, 4 even digits (2,4,6,8). So probability first digit odd = 5/9.

But the problem might be about "k numbers" not digits.

Another possibility: The problem might be: "We choose a random subset of size k from the set {1,...,2N}." Then the probability that the first number in that set (maybe the smallest?) is odd? Actually if we choose k numbers uniformly at random from 1..n (without replacement). Then we want probability that the smallest selected number is odd; that's maybe (??). Actually we can compute the distribution of minimal value of a random k-subset. The number of subsets with min value m and the rest any k-1 elements from [m+1,n] is C(n-m, k-1). So probability min=m is C(n-m, k-1) / C(n, k). Then probability min odd = sum over odd m of that. But that's complicated.

But perhaps the problem is simpler: "We are selecting k distinct positive integers uniformly at random from the set {1,2,...,n}. What is the probability that the smallest of these numbers is odd?" Then we could answer: It equals 0 if n < 1? Eh.

Alternatively maybe it's "We are selecting k numbers from the set {1,2,...,N}. What is the probability that the first of the k numbers is odd?" If we choose them sequentially without replacement, then the first drawn
