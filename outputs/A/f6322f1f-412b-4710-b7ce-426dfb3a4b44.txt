A) is in the range of $\Gamma^T$, i.e., in the column space of $\Gamma^T$, we can solve for $\theta$:

- For example, if $\theta = a$ is a column vector.

Given that, perhaps the problem reduces to solving for $a$ in $\Gamma^T a = \Gamma \beta - A$.

Given that, perhaps we can find $a$ via the pseudo-inverse.

But perhaps we can consider that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write $A = \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a$.

Therefore, if we can find $a$, we can find $A$.

Similarly, from $D = - \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T b$; thus, $- D = \Gamma \beta + \Gamma^T b$.

Therefore, $- D + \Gamma^T b = \Gamma \beta$

Similarly, from earlier, $A = \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a$

Thus, if we can find $a$ and $b$ satisfying these equations, we can find $A$ and $D$.

Now, perhaps we can write this as a linear system:

Let me define the variables:

Let me define $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$.

Then, we have:

- $A = \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a$

- $D = - \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T b$

Now, we can think about the following:

- From the first equation, we have $A + \Gamma^T a = \Gamma \beta$

Similarly, from the second equation:

- $- D - \Gamma^T b = \Gamma \beta$

Thus, we have:

- $- D - \Gamma^T b = \Gamma \beta$

Now, perhaps we can equate:

- $A + \Gamma^T a = - D - \Gamma^T b$

But perhaps this leads us to:

$A + \Gamma^T a + D + \Gamma^T b = 0$

Then, grouping:

$A + D + \Gamma^T (a + b) = 0$

Now, $A$ and $D$ are known matrices, and $\Gamma^T$ is known. Therefore, we can consider this as an equation in $a + b$.

Similarly, perhaps we can write:

Given that $\Gamma^T (a + b) = - (A + D)$

Now, perhaps we can solve for $a + b$:

If $\Gamma^T$ has full rank, i.e., the columns span $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the equation:

$\Gamma^T (a + b) = - (A + D)$ implies that $a + b = - (\Gamma^T)^{\dagger} (A + D)$

Here $(\Gamma^T)^{\dagger}$ is the pseudo-inverse of $\Gamma^T$, but if $\Gamma^T$ is invertible, then we can write $a + b = - (\Gamma^T)^{-1} (A + D)$

Then, we can think in terms:

From earlier, we had $A = \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a$

Similarly, $D = - \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T b$

Therefore, $A + D = (\Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a) + (- \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T b) = - \Gamma^T a - \Gamma^T b = - \Gamma^T (a + b)$

Thus, $A + D = - \Gamma^T (a + b)$

Therefore, from above:

But this is consistent with the earlier expression.

Now, if we denote $C := a + b$, then $A + D = - \Gamma^T C$

Therefore, $C = - (\Gamma^T)^{-1} (A + D)$

Hence, $C = - (\Gamma^T)^{-1} (A + D)$

Now, from earlier, $A = \Gamma \beta - \Gamma^T a$

Similarly, rearranged: $\Gamma^T a = \Gamma \beta - A$

Similarly, $a = (\Gamma^T)^{-1} (\Gamma \beta - A)$.

Similarly, $b = C - a = -(\Gamma^T)^{-1} (A + D) - a$

Therefore, perhaps this gets complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to attempt a different approach.

Let me attempt to proceed via the spectral decomposition.

Given that, perhaps we can attempt to find the spectral decomposition of $\Gamma
