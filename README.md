# GPT-OSS Reverse Engineering

*Disclaimer: This README is mayjorly generated by Cursor*

This repository is dedicated to reverse engineering the training data distribution of the brand new GPT-OSS models by analyzing their random generation patterns when prompted with single words.

## Project Overview

The project uses GPT-OSS-20B model to generate random samples starting with common English words, then analyzes the patterns in the generated content to understand the model's training data distribution.

## Methodology

- **Prompt Strategy**: Uses the 10 most common English words as starting prompts
- **Model**: GPT-OSS-20B via OpenRouter API
- **Generation**: 16 samples per word with temperature=1.0 for maximum randomness
- **Analysis**: Examines content patterns to understand training data composition

## Data Collection

The project collected 160 samples total (16 samples × 10 words) across these categories:

| Word | Samples | Content Focus |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **The** | 16 | Technical documentation, code explanations, educational content |
| **This** | 16 | Code walkthroughs, implementation details, debugging explanations |
| **How** | 16 | Mathematical proofs, algorithmic explanations, problem-solving |
| **Why** | 16 | Software architecture, best practices, design decisions |
| **What** | 16 | Technical troubleshooting, API documentation, error analysis |
| **A** | 16 | Web development tutorials, UI/UX explanations, code examples |
| **An** | 16 | Algorithm analysis, data structures, computational complexity |
| **In** | 16 | Software development scenarios, cross-platform implementations |
| **New** | 16 | Programming tutorials, code serialization, technical implementations |

## Dependencies

- `requests>=2.32.4` - API communication
- `tqdm>=4.67.1` - Progress tracking
- `ipykernel>=6.30.1` - Jupyter notebook support

## Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. To set up the project:

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd gpt-oss-reverse-engineering

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

## Usage

The main functionality is in the Jupyter notebook:

1. **Data Collection**: Run `notebooks/random_generation.ipynb` to collect samples
2. **Analysis**: Examine the generated content in the `outputs/` directory
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify training data distribution patterns

## Example Outputs

Here are three typical examples showcasing the diverse content patterns generated by GPT-OSS:

### 1. Code Documentation ("The" prompt)
```
The main difference is that the `if` statement evaluates the condition in the parentheses and executes the block of code if the condition is true, while the `case` statement compares a value against multiple expressions and executes a block of code based on the matching expression.

Here is a concise summary of the key differences between the if statement and the switch statement in C#:

1. Syntax: The if statement uses a boolean expression in parentheses and executes a block of code if the expression is true, while the switch statement uses a single expression, which can be of various types, and evaluates it against multiple expressions. The block of code is executed when there is a match.

2. Purpose: The if statement is used for evaluating a single condition or multiple conditions in a hierarchical manner, while the switch statement is used for evaluating a single value against multiple cases.
```

### 2. Mathematical Problem-Solving ("How" prompt)
```
How many edges are there in this graph?" They might want answer in terms of m and n. So we answer that there's 4m + 5(-2m + 3n - 2) = 5(3n - 2) - 4m edges.

Alternatively, combine if one desires: 35n - 18? Wait, 12m + 15n = 3(4m+5n). So answer: 3(4m+5n). Given that. So answer. Alternatively 12m + 15n.

We might also mention that there is greater weight not used for soap foam graph. But that's not asked.

Thus answer: 12m + 15n.

But maybe they want explanation: The graph is a planar graph with vertices and edges. So graph edges can be counted using Euler's formula?
```

### 3. Programming Tutorial ("New" prompt)
```
New York",
  "age": 28,
  "children": {
    "child1": "Alice",
    "child2": "Bob"
  }
}
```

In Java, this would be represented using Maps and Lists.

The code would read from a JSON file, parse it into a Java Map or custom data class, then serialize it into a binary format, write it back to a file, read it again, and deserialize to a Map or custom object, then reconstruct to JSON for comparison.

```java
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import com.fasterxml.jackson.core.type.TypeReference;

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class JsonSerializationTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        // Original JSON string
        String originalJson = "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"address\":\"123 Main St, New York\",\"age\":28,\"children\":{\"child1\":\"Alice\",\"child2\":\"Bob\"}}";

        // Parse JSON into a Java Map
        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Map<String, Object> originalMap = mapper.readValue(originalJson, new TypeReference<Map<String, Object>>(){});
```

## Key Insights

This reverse engineering approach reveals that GPT-OSS models are heavily trained on programming and technical content, making them particularly effective for software development tasks, code explanation, and technical documentation generation. The overwhelming dominance of programming-related content suggests these models are optimized for developer assistance and technical communication.
